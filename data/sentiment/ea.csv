They say no, they are gonna make their game. You can't use anything from the universe. This says to me, Brads game will suck. 

I wish they would have gotten together and made the best game, instead were getting one well planned game, with hardly anything star Control in it except for the name, and a reboot of SC2 with new elements. I would rather have a new game with SC elements in it than a reboot. 

That's just my preference, I could be wrong.

As far as the legal wrangling goes, I am on Brads side. I am amazed others aren't either, so many times we as gamers lament companies shutting down derivative works, or even whole new works based on existing franchises. Works made by fans of the game they are basing their games universe in. Well, Brad isn't a big name company like Blizz or EA, he is a fan, and his game would have been just as good, even better with Reche and Fords input and creative bent. 

Whoever wins this, we lose. If Stardock wins Rieche and Ford will not get to make a game, And Brads game is painted in a bad light and will probably bomb.  And If Rieche and Ford win we get a SC2 reboot which may or may not be good. 5 years of work Brad put into something he was truly a fan of is lost.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

They say no, they are gonna make their game. You can't use anything from the universe. This says to me, Brads game will suck. 

I wish they would have gotten together and made the best game, instead were getting one well planned game, with hardly anything star Control in it except for the name, and a reboot of SC2 with new elements. I would rather have a new game with SC elements in it than a reboot. 

That's just my preference, I could be wrong.

As far as the legal wrangling goes, I am on Brads side. I am amazed others aren't either, so many times we as gamers lament companies shutting down derivative works, or even whole new works based on existing franchises. Works made by fans of the game they are basing their games universe in. Well, Brad isn't a big name company like Blizz or EA, he is a fan, and his game would have been just as good, even better with Reche and Fords input and creative bent. 

Whoever wins this, we lose. If Stardock wins Rieche and Ford will not get to make a game, And Brads game is painted in a bad light and will probably bomb.  And If Rieche and Ford win we get a SC2 reboot which may or may not be good. 5 years of work Brad put into something he was truly a fan of is lost.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Most of my gaming on PC now consists of indie titles that aren't afraid to try something new, or older games that still have a healthy modding scene.

I play the odd big-name title but they're becoming so formulaic and unimaginative. 

All Ubisoft games are basically the same shit and have been since Assassin's Creed 2. Theme-park environments artificially crafted around collectibles and junk loot.

EA just keeps pulling scummy monetisation moves and as a long-time Battlefield fan, the last two got old pretty fucking fast. I barely clocked up 30 hours before I decided I was done. I preferred the older ones.

Diablo 3 was a huge disappointment for me. I can't stand MMO's. MOBAs or Fortnite etc. Then again, I haven't liked a single Blizzard game apart from Diablo 1 and 2, and they weren't developed by Blizzard themselves.

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

The game came out in May of 2012. At the end of 2012 they had sold about 12 million copies. That means over half of their sales came after the first 6 months of sales. I have a hard time believing the majority of those sales were just because of ""marketing and goodwill"".

&gt;in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics but 41 for the user score.

No one cares about user scores, because they're hardly representative. Most people who are happy with the game aren't going to leave a review, and the user reviews were flooded with angry players leaving multiple negative reviews. 

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Either way I hope the project leads are rewarded by heaps and bounds for what they did with Anthem's marketing. They were already busy making the game and they made time to do all this by themselves.",1546316265,1,1546312665.0,EA,0.97173035

Most of my gaming on PC now consists of indie titles that aren't afraid to try something new, or older games that still have a healthy modding scene.

I play the odd big-name title but they're becoming so formulaic and unimaginative. 

All Ubisoft games are basically the same shit and have been since Assassin's Creed 2. Theme-park environments artificially crafted around collectibles and junk loot.

EA just keeps pulling scummy monetisation moves and as a long-time Battlefield fan, the last two got old pretty fucking fast. I barely clocked up 30 hours before I decided I was done. I preferred the older ones.

Diablo 3 was a huge disappointment for me. I can't stand MMO's. MOBAs or Fortnite etc. Then again, I haven't liked a single Blizzard game apart from Diablo 1 and 2, and they weren't developed by Blizzard themselves.

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.

217,217,captain_tedious,"You’re assuming a lot with that statement. You need to consider the following:

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

The game came out in May of 2012. At the end of 2012 they had sold about 12 million copies. That means over half of their sales came after the first 6 months of sales. I have a hard time believing the majority of those sales were just because of ""marketing and goodwill"".

&gt;in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics but 41 for the user score.

No one cares about user scores, because they're hardly representative. Most people who are happy with the game aren't going to leave a review, and the user reviews were flooded with angry players leaving multiple negative reviews. 

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch.

That is actually not true, you are just trying to make claims based on your false assumption. The mobile game is only part of the reason why Blizz is on the decline but you probably wouldn't realize that because you are to busy just trying to pull shit out your ass to try to argue. Where as I'm actually speaking from experience. For example, I've played WoW for many years and due to the shit job they did on BFA (Battle for Azeroth is a expansion to a PC game) has lead to everyone in my 200 man guild un-subbing and apparently the same has happened to my friends and their guilds. Not to mention that the number of subscribers to /r/wow has greatly decreased since the expansions release and I've yet to see any discussion about WoW in a positive light on that subreddit for a while. Then there is Overwatch. Everyone I know who used to play it has quit and when I bring it up in discussion with them they say they and their friends have quit because it has gotten boring and stale. The only good stuff about Blizz that I have heard recently was about how people were sad they moved people off the HotS team because it was a really good game.

232,232,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

b) the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

c) the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the games. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

d) the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

284,284,werpu,"AAA is also underwhelming on the consoles. Sony keeps it up. Microsoft dropped out of the AAA game almost entirely this generation and Nintendo is Nintendo.Whatever comes out at AAA level from the other publishers is lootbox hell, shooter 5001 and or a combination of both or the usual lootbox infested EA sports game.

I am so glad that the indie scene took off so well the last years, I am not sure if we see one of the big publishers fall within the next years, but the time would be ripe to have that happen. Soft of like the video market cleansing in the early 80s. (Aint gonna happen again)

286,286,Wetzilla,"&gt; it s almost like diablo was one of the most loved franchises of all time and blizzard had a ton of good will back then + insane marketing budget. the merit of the sales was not from the game itself.

The game came out in May of 2012. At the end of 2012 they had sold about 12 million copies. That means over half of their sales came after the first 6 months of sales. I have a hard time believing the majority of those sales were just because of ""marketing and goodwill"".

&gt;in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics but 41 for the user score.

No one cares about user scores, because they're hardly representative. Most people who are happy with the game aren't going to leave a review, and the user reviews were flooded with angry players leaving multiple negative reviews. 

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch. 

&gt;by your standards mass effect andromeda was a fantastic success and EA is crazy for freezing it

How? The only sales numbers we have for ME:A put it at 2.5 million copies, and it has a 71% on metacritic. Those are not even close to what Diablo 3 accomplished. ",1546373552,1,1546369952.0,EA,0.49814224

This is actually the first time on here I've seen someone argue on here for the sake of arguing. Truly pathetic. 

&gt; Yall argue dumb positions like thinking that massive video game companies are going downhill because they announced a mobile game

That is actually not true, you are just trying to make claims based on your false assumption. The mobile game is only part of the reason why Blizz is on the decline but you probably wouldn't realize that because you are to busy just trying to pull shit out your ass to try to argue. Where as I'm actually speaking from experience. For example, I've played WoW for many years and due to the shit job they did on BFA (Battle for Azeroth is a expansion to a PC game) has lead to everyone in my 200 man guild un-subbing and apparently the same has happened to my friends and their guilds. Not to mention that the number of subscribers to /r/wow has greatly decreased since the expansions release and I've yet to see any discussion about WoW in a positive light on that subreddit for a while. Then there is Overwatch. Everyone I know who used to play it has quit and when I bring it up in discussion with them they say they and their friends have quit because it has gotten boring and stale. The only good stuff about Blizz that I have heard recently was about how people were sad they moved people off the HotS team because it was a really good game.

&gt; I argue intelligent positions like the opposite of whatever yall think

291,291,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.  Something that's a complete package and not purpose built simply to continually extract the money from my wallet.

They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.  It might win my game of the year next year, but it'll be a year late.  The fact is PC gets a decent amount of games, but most games are arriving just late enough to feel a year behind. 

It doesn't help that the biggest and best games this year came from Sony, but the fact is the PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles, and most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles. 

Seeing Ninja Theory carted off to Microsoft's camp has me worried, as they're a great PC dev, who might become console only (I hope not, but we might not see them on Steam).  Blizzard and Bethesda have gone in interesting ways this year that is probably bad and if EA every makes another top tier game, Origin will still be a black mark on it (just play it on console).

335,335,captain_tedious,"You’re assuming a lot with that statement. You need to consider the following:

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

Microsoft and Sony don't release these numbers but I have seen some rumblings that it's between 5% and 20%.

342,342,Wetzilla,"&gt; it s almost like diablo was one of the most loved franchises of all time and blizzard had a ton of good will back then + insane marketing budget. the merit of the sales was not from the game itself.

The game came out in May of 2012. At the end of 2012 they had sold about 12 million copies. That means over half of their sales came after the first 6 months of sales. I have a hard time believing the majority of those sales were just because of ""marketing and goodwill"".

&gt;in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics but 41 for the user score.

No one cares about user scores, because they're hardly representative. Most people who are happy with the game aren't going to leave a review, and the user reviews were flooded with angry players leaving multiple negative reviews. 

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch. 

&gt;by your standards mass effect andromeda was a fantastic success and EA is crazy for freezing it

This is actually the first time on here I've seen someone argue on here for the sake of arguing. Truly pathetic. 

&gt; Yall argue dumb positions like thinking that massive video game companies are going downhill because they announced a mobile game

That is actually not true, you are just trying to make claims based on your false assumption. The mobile game is only part of the reason why Blizz is on the decline but you probably wouldn't realize that because you are to busy just trying to pull shit out your ass to try to argue. Where as I'm actually speaking from experience. For example, I've played WoW for many years and due to the shit job they did on BFA (Battle for Azeroth is a expansion to a PC game) has lead to everyone in my 200 man guild un-subbing and apparently the same has happened to my friends and their guilds. Not to mention that the number of subscribers to /r/wow has greatly decreased since the expansions release and I've yet to see any discussion about WoW in a positive light on that subreddit for a while. Then there is Overwatch. Everyone I know who used to play it has quit and when I bring it up in discussion with them they say they and their friends have quit because it has gotten boring and stale. The only good stuff about Blizz that I have heard recently was about how people were sad they moved people off the HotS team because it was a really good game.

347,347,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Either way I hope the project leads are rewarded by heaps and bounds for what they did with Anthem's marketing. They were already busy making the game and they made time to do all this by themselves.",1546316265,1,1546312665.0,EA,0.97173035

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

The game came out in May of 2012. At the end of 2012 they had sold about 12 million copies. That means over half of their sales came after the first 6 months of sales. I have a hard time believing the majority of those sales were just because of ""marketing and goodwill"".

&gt;in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics but 41 for the user score.

No one cares about user scores, because they're hardly representative. Most people who are happy with the game aren't going to leave a review, and the user reviews were flooded with angry players leaving multiple negative reviews. 

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch.

That is actually not true, you are just trying to make claims based on your false assumption. The mobile game is only part of the reason why Blizz is on the decline but you probably wouldn't realize that because you are to busy just trying to pull shit out your ass to try to argue. Where as I'm actually speaking from experience. For example, I've played WoW for many years and due to the shit job they did on BFA (Battle for Azeroth is a expansion to a PC game) has lead to everyone in my 200 man guild un-subbing and apparently the same has happened to my friends and their guilds. Not to mention that the number of subscribers to /r/wow has greatly decreased since the expansions release and I've yet to see any discussion about WoW in a positive light on that subreddit for a while. Then there is Overwatch. Everyone I know who used to play it has quit and when I bring it up in discussion with them they say they and their friends have quit because it has gotten boring and stale.

401,401,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch. 

&gt;by your standards mass effect andromeda was a fantastic success and EA is crazy for freezing it

How? The only sales numbers we have for ME:A put it at 2.5 million copies, and it has a 71% on metacritic. Those are not even close to what Diablo 3 accomplished. ",1546373552,1,1546369952.0,EA,0.49814224

This is actually the first time on here I've seen someone argue on here for the sake of arguing. Truly pathetic. 

&gt; Yall argue dumb positions like thinking that massive video game companies are going downhill because they announced a mobile game

That is actually not true, you are just trying to make claims based on your false assumption. The mobile game is only part of the reason why Blizz is on the decline but you probably wouldn't realize that because you are to busy just trying to pull shit out your ass to try to argue. Where as I'm actually speaking from experience. For example, I've played WoW for many years and due to the shit job they did on BFA (Battle for Azeroth is a expansion to a PC game) has lead to everyone in my 200 man guild un-subbing and apparently the same has happened to my friends and their guilds. Not to mention that the number of subscribers to /r/wow has greatly decreased since the expansions release and I've yet to see any discussion about WoW in a positive light on that subreddit for a while. Then there is Overwatch. Everyone I know who used to play it has quit and when I bring it up in discussion with them they say they and their friends have quit because it has gotten boring and stale. The only good stuff about Blizz that I have heard recently was about how people were sad they moved people off the HotS team because it was a really good game.

&gt; I argue intelligent positions like the opposite of whatever yall think

452,452,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.  Something that's a complete package and not purpose built simply to continually extract the money from my wallet.

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.  It might win my game of the year next year, but it'll be a year late.  The fact is PC gets a decent amount of games, but most games are arriving just late enough to feel a year behind. 

It doesn't help that the biggest and best games this year came from Sony, but the fact is the PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles, and most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles. 

Seeing Ninja Theory carted off to Microsoft's camp has me worried, as they're a great PC dev, who might become console only (I hope not, but we might not see them on Steam).  Blizzard and Bethesda have gone in interesting ways this year that is probably bad and if EA every makes another top tier game, Origin will still be a black mark on it (just play it on console). 

That doesn't mean it's a bad year for gaming at all, but PC definitely has a different look with more games like Celeste and Into the Breach, and yearly Ubisoft titles, but otherwise... we're on ""dad time"" getting shit about 6 months later",1546341539,1,1546337939.0,EA,0.96715254

490,490,captain_tedious,"You’re assuming a lot with that statement. You need to consider the following:

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

Microsoft and Sony don't release these numbers but I have seen some rumblings that it's between 5% and 20%. But there's also more production cost on console as people want physical copies, but that's publisher overhead as far as I know.

I am so glad that the indie scene took off so well the last years, I am not sure if we see one of the big publishers fall within the next years, but the time would be ripe to have that happen. Soft of like the video market cleansing in the early 80s. (Aint gonna happen again)

497,497,Wetzilla,"&gt; it s almost like diablo was one of the most loved franchises of all time and blizzard had a ton of good will back then + insane marketing budget. the merit of the sales was not from the game itself.

The game came out in May of 2012. At the end of 2012 they had sold about 12 million copies. That means over half of their sales came after the first 6 months of sales. I have a hard time believing the majority of those sales were just because of ""marketing and goodwill"".

&gt;in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics but 41 for the user score.

No one cares about user scores, because they're hardly representative. Most people who are happy with the game aren't going to leave a review, and the user reviews were flooded with angry players leaving multiple negative reviews. 

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch. 

&gt;by your standards mass effect andromeda was a fantastic success and EA is crazy for freezing it

500,500,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.  Something that's a complete package and not purpose built simply to continually extract the money from my wallet.

And I admit I haven't played everything this year... but looking back.... yeah it's been a weaker year for PC.  That doesn't mean PC doesn't have great games this year, Monster Hunter World, and Yakuza are both really good, and one will be on my list.  

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.  It might win my game of the year next year, but it'll be a year late.  The fact is PC gets a decent amount of games, but most games are arriving just late enough to feel a year behind. 

It doesn't help that the biggest and best games this year came from Sony, but the fact is the PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles, and most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles. 

Seeing Ninja Theory carted off to Microsoft's camp has me worried, as they're a great PC dev, who might become console only (I hope not, but we might not see them on Steam).  Blizzard and Bethesda have gone in interesting ways this year that is probably bad and if EA every makes another top tier game, Origin will still be a black mark on it (just play it on console).

535,535,captain_tedious,"You’re assuming a lot with that statement. You need to consider the following:

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

Microsoft and Sony don't release these numbers but I have seen some rumblings that it's between 5% and 20%.

542,542,Wetzilla,"&gt; it s almost like diablo was one of the most loved franchises of all time and blizzard had a ton of good will back then + insane marketing budget. the merit of the sales was not from the game itself.

The game came out in May of 2012. At the end of 2012 they had sold about 12 million copies. That means over half of their sales came after the first 6 months of sales. I have a hard time believing the majority of those sales were just because of ""marketing and goodwill"".

&gt;in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics but 41 for the user score.

No one cares about user scores, because they're hardly representative. Most people who are happy with the game aren't going to leave a review, and the user reviews were flooded with angry players leaving multiple negative reviews. 

&gt;the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

Do you have literally any source for this? in March of 2013, almost a year after the game came out, Blizzard reported that the game still had over 1 million daily players, and 3 million unique players each month. That seems pretty good to me.

&gt;the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the game. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

So? That doesn't mean it was a gigantic failure. Just not quite as successful as their other massively successful games.

&gt;the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

So wait, was it a skeleton crew doing minimal work on the game or did they spend a lot of resources to continually improve it? And the AH was removed almost two years after the game launched, is that really ""close to the start of it's cycle""? 

&gt;the game lost big market share to indie tier competitors.

Again, do you have any evidence of this? I'm sure they lost some, because there weren't many indie ARPGs until the past 5 to 10 years or so, but 30 million copies still seems like a lot. And it is still doing well enough for them to port it to the Switch. 

&gt;by your standards mass effect andromeda was a fantastic success and EA is crazy for freezing it

545,545,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.

They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days.

And I admit I haven't played everything this year... but looking back.... yeah it's been a weaker year for PC.  That doesn't mean PC doesn't have great games this year, Monster Hunter World, and Yakuza are both really good, and one will be on my list.  

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.  It might win my game of the year next year, but it'll be a year late.  The fact is PC gets a decent amount of games, but most games are arriving just late enough to feel a year behind. 

It doesn't help that the biggest and best games this year came from Sony, but the fact is the PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles, and most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles. 

Seeing Ninja Theory carted off to Microsoft's camp has me worried, as they're a great PC dev, who might become console only (I hope not, but we might not see them on Steam).  Blizzard and Bethesda have gone in interesting ways this year that is probably bad and if EA every makes another top tier game, Origin will still be a black mark on it (just play it on console).

577,577,captain_tedious,"You’re assuming a lot with that statement. You need to consider the following:

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

you can easily check this, since : 

a) in your own example, the metacritic is 88 for critics and 41 for the user score.

b) the player retention was terrible. the drop in the number of players was fast and extreme

c) the player retention was so terrible there was minimal attempts to monetize the games. it has the lowest amount of xpacs/dlcs/content of all modern blizzard games. obviously the lowest number of people working on it, it was a skeleton crew for quite some time.

d) the game had a gigantic '' remake '' in it s features close to the start of it's cycle. loot was remade, AH was removed, xpac changed almost everything, management of the project changed etc.

by your standards mass effect andromeda was a fantastic success and EA is crazy for freezing it. turns out damaging your brand is a  thing. it takes a lot of time to get the goodwill blizzard had/has but it only takes fucking some times to destroy a franchise.

Microsoft and Sony don't release these numbers but I have seen some rumblings that it's between 5% and 20%.

584,584,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.  Something that's a complete package and not purpose built simply to continually extract the money from my wallet.

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one.

They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

Microsoft and Sony don't release these numbers but I have seen some rumblings that it's between 5% and 20%.

618,618,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.  Something that's a complete package and not purpose built simply to continually extract the money from my wallet.

But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.  It might win my game of the year next year, but it'll be a year late.  The fact is PC gets a decent amount of games, but most games are arriving just late enough to feel a year behind. 

It doesn't help that the biggest and best games this year came from Sony, but the fact is the PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles, and most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles. 

Seeing Ninja Theory carted off to Microsoft's camp has me worried, as they're a great PC dev, who might become console only (I hope not, but we might not see them on Steam).  Blizzard and Bethesda have gone in interesting ways this year that is probably bad and if EA every makes another top tier game, Origin will still be a black mark on it (just play it on console).

671,671,captain_tedious,"You’re assuming a lot with that statement. You need to consider the following:

1.	Only about 50% of the revenue goes towards the development costs.
2.	Not all sales are at $60.
3.	“Profitable” does not just mean it made more revenue than its expenses. It needs to return a ROR greater than cost of capital, and cover overhead, which typically means somewhere around 10-15%. And for that you have to consider things like 

Given those, it’s easy to get to some numbers where it isn’t profitable, especially if it’s at the low end of that 2-3 million sales. 

For example: 2 million sales times an average sales price of $45 times 50% = $45 million in net revenue. Spread that over two years following release and put your $40 million in capital over 2-3 year prior to release and you’re looking at a 6% ROR or lower. That’s not profitable for *any* company.

But beyond that, even if it *was* slightly profitable, that doesn’t mean it would be a good idea for EA to make another one. In pretty much all corporations projects compete for capital dollars from limited budgets. Projects don’t just have to be profitable. They have to be *more* profitable than other projects the company can choose to invest in.

There’s also the matter of risk to consider. For example, one could reasonably assume that sales of Andromeda were buoyed by expectations set by the prior entries in the series and that EA would expect any follow ups to have lower sales following Andromeda’s disappointing performance.",1546352207,1,1546348607.0,EA,0.00911906

And I admit I haven't played everything this year... but looking back.... yeah it's been a weaker year for PC.  That doesn't mean PC doesn't have great games this year, Monster Hunter World, and Yakuza are both really good, and one will be on my list.  

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.  It might win my game of the year next year, but it'll be a year late.  The fact is PC gets a decent amount of games, but most games are arriving just late enough to feel a year behind. 

It doesn't help that the biggest and best games this year came from Sony, but the fact is the PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles, and most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles. 

Seeing Ninja Theory carted off to Microsoft's camp has me worried, as they're a great PC dev, who might become console only (I hope not, but we might not see them on Steam).  Blizzard and Bethesda have gone in interesting ways this year that is probably bad and if EA every makes another top tier game, Origin will still be a black mark on it (just play it on console).

695,695,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.

And I admit I haven't played everything this year... but looking back.... yeah it's been a weaker year for PC.  That doesn't mean PC doesn't have great games this year, Monster Hunter World, and Yakuza are both really good, and one will be on my list.  

But the thing is both of these games are only ""new"" on PC.   Even if I wanted to, Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't released this year.  It might win my game of the year next year, but it'll be a year late.  The fact is PC gets a decent amount of games, but most games are arriving just late enough to feel a year behind. 

It doesn't help that the biggest and best games this year came from Sony, but the fact is the PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles, and most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles. 

Seeing Ninja Theory carted off to Microsoft's camp has me worried, as they're a great PC dev, who might become console only (I hope not, but we might not see them on Steam).  Blizzard and Bethesda have gone in interesting ways this year that is probably bad and if EA every makes another top tier game, Origin will still be a black mark on it (just play it on console). 

That doesn't mean it's a bad year for gaming at all, but PC definitely has a different look with more games like Celeste and Into the Breach, and yearly Ubisoft titles, but otherwise... we're on ""dad time"" getting shit about 6 months later",1546341539,1,1546337939.0,EA,0.96715254
731,731,aniaran,"Honestly?  Possibly.  There's something to be said for a studio having a closed loop to their game.  I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.  I might be totally incorrect about that but with EA's shift to live services and the information I have seen about it that seems to be the mindset.  

I don't really enjoy those games that much to begin with, but I also don't trust EA or Bioware any more due to their recent string of fuckups.  I'm happy to just wait and see if it pans out how I expect or if I can actually find a game the equivalent of the original Mass Effect, Prey, or Doom buried in Anthem.

But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Either way I hope the project leads are rewarded by heaps and bounds for what they did with Anthem's marketing. They were already busy making the game and they made time to do all this by themselves.",1546316265,1,1546312665.0,EA,0.97173035

I don't think it would work for Anthem as that's against the core design philosophy of the game but for others it works wonderfully.  Look at God of War.  The game is fantastic largely because it's a complete package.  

I experienced gaming prior to the internet being a significant factor, and there was a significant difference in approach to game design.  For some it worked wonderfully, for others it caused them to fall flat on their face on release due to bugs and technical issues or a poor design, but regardless of end result the game had to be a cohesive whole.  You didn't see games released with missing features, or with expected aspects that are oddly missing with the intent to add later via dlc or such because that wasn't a possibility.  It was a design with intent to make the most appealing whole because that was the only way to survive as  developer.  If your game wasn't the most interesting/enjoyable/well received then people wouldn't buy it (barring a few exceptions due to brand name).  

For Anthem I don't think that philosophy would work largely because that's not how I see the game as having been designed from the ground up.  It's focus is player engagement and return, in order to try to sell the after-purchase monetizations.

The only AAA games we didn't get this year were RDR2 (which could come to PC in theory, but Rockstar is doing Rockstar things), God of War, Detroid (which is a pretty special case game, because David De Gruttola aka David Cage) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Have I forgotten anything? Wasn't there a new Yakuza game for PS4?

But on the PC side we got:
- Battlefield V (release was bad, but it's still a pretty good game, that also looks insanely good on PC if you have the hardware)
- Hitman 2 (feels a bit overlooked this year)
- CoD: BO4
- FarCry 5
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Monster Hunter: World
- Sea of Thieves
- Forza Horizon 4
- Sports games like Fifa
- Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Dragon Ball FighterZ (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Soulcalibur VI (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Hunt Showdown (maybe, it's still early access)

There are also some games with not the best reception like State of Decay 2, The Fallout game that shall not be named, etc.

In addition we have our constantly updated games, that are very big on PC too: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, DotA2, Warframe, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. (even Warcraft 3 got some love)

And if that's not enough, the indies (and friends) this year were sick too. Return of the Obra Dinn, Celeste, The Messenger, Dead Cells, Frostpunk, Into the Breach, Ashen, Below, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Banner Saga 3, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, Subnautica, Beat Saber, GRIS, X4: Foundations, Mega Man 11 (not an indie), Wizard of Legend, etc

For me it was an amazing year as a PC gamer. Ofc if you only look at PC exclusive AAA games for PC, then almost every year is a bad year for PC, because PC is an open platform and no deals prevent developers/publishers from releasing their games on other platforms too, so ofc if it's on pc and playable on other systems, then there will be a port at some point.

Why does it matter? All CoDs are the same, so is every fifa, nhl or madden.

Atlas is different enough to be a stand alone game.

Counter-Strike started as a Half-Life Mod, Mario Party only adds a few more boards and minigames each time. Smash Bros just upgrades the graphics each time.

Atlas is early acces, it‘s basically a playable alpha/beta. They told us so before release. They said Early Access would go on for two years. 
They never said it was going to be a smooth as a baby‘s butt full release experience.
It‘s an ‚MMO‘. Stuff breaks, servers are gonna be packed. There isn‘t a single MMO game that hyped that launched without a hitch.
Diablo 3 had Error 37, WoW had hour long queues for each server, Bless online was worse than any launch ever and people still played it. Even Wildstar (rip) had problems at launch.

Why should Atlas be any different? 
What did you expect?
Think before you buy, stop acting on impulses. 

I spent 40 hours in Atlas so far. I refunded Ark two times. It is not Ark. Ark is a hot pile of garbage compared to Atlas.
 Atlas is a decent Alpha, playable with hiccups. I can run it on my potato PC. Stop crying and get your act together. Maybe you‘ll enjoy Atlas more when it officially releases.

838,52,Eurehetemec,"&gt; Did McDonald's offer healthy choices because they were legislated to do so, or was their demand from the consumer for a healthy option and McDonald's responded?

Both. In the UK, for example, they were faced with legislation, and acted before it came in, but have also been faced with responding to legislation. They looked at which way the wind was blowing.

Again your bad analogy is helpful to my argument, though, because even if it was demand from the customer then see below:

&gt; If you don't like or agree with the gambling features, don't buy the game. See how fast they would sell a version without that if it started to effect their bottom line.

These are licensed sports game. Not just ""games"". They sell specifically because they're officially licensed. Let's take the license away from EA, and see how well they sell with the UT shit, how about that? A huge proportion of the sales are to young fans of the sport, who just want the ""official"" game.

Even we go with your factually-incorrect implication that it was purely customer demand that changed McDonald's, the customers don't really have another option here. If they want to play a football game with the correct, real-world teams and players and so on, they pretty much have to buy FIFA or nothing at all, and most of them, being football fans, grin and bear it.

So your analogy here would be, say, that McDonald's was literally the only place which was allowed to sell beef burgers, everywhere else had to sell soy or lamb or chicken or whatever.

I can see you're having some trouble processing this intellectually, given the weak and context-less arguments and bad analogies you're using.

&gt; Do you think I'm a libertarian because I value personal accountability?

Nice backpedal. ""Valuing personal accountability"" is not at all the same thing as:

You don't ""value"" personal accountability, you put absolutely everything on it and discount everything else. Normal people value personal accountability, but they don't believe it's ""100%"" (and no-one forced you to use such a horseshit number) on consumers, many of whom are children.

To set expectations correctly here: I am not saying positively, affirmatively, that the Frostbite engine ""doesn't"", or ""can't"" run on the Switch. I'm specifically saying that this article, and the source cited, are confirming *nothing*. It's barely anything more than a rumor based on this.

To clarify something here, ""SDK"" is a term that can be given broad usage. I've worked on SDKs for game companies before - not AAA ones - but it did not commonly refer to the game's engine. In fact I would expect someone to use that term directly if the graphics pipeline or entity capabilities were something they were coding for. SDKs more commonly refer to a set of tools to access online services. Say EA has a dozen games that use online matchmaking; they could all very likely use the same SDK, connecting to the same backend to provide leaderboards, matchmaking, or even player analytics like number of times booted up. This could even mean an indie team making a small multiplayer game for EA could connect to their SDK even when using Unity. Doctre81 mentions FIFA was on Switch, which could very well be the one game they ported some sort of SDK for.

Plus, this could be simply a confirmation that this engineer successfully completed work that was not used. Say his work was on a UI toolkit - he may have very successfully ported that toolkit from PS4 to the Switch - and then two months later, it is very possible for the leads to say ""All right, well, the business/tech/licensing side is not looking good, so we're cancelling plans to develop a game for the Nintendo Switch."" This very sort of thing has happened to me in my work - successfully completing a useful tool that then no longer matches what the company is going for. What's more, an engineer would be very likely to put this sort of information on his resume - he may have done very good work here that will never be seen as part of a public product.

863,77,Django117,"It's profitable to be an asshole. The issue is that video games have changed due to the mobile market. Where in the past there were considerable distribution costs, publishers, etc. in the middle, in present day you can just write an app/make a game and post it directly to a mobile store with little effort. These games are built using cheap assets, quick and poor coding, and mostly marketing budgets. They are filled to the brim with microtransactions and built to ensnare people. 

These games are incredibly profitable and have an insanely low cost as most of the development takes place in Asia. The sales happen worldwide and in places such as China, the US, and Europe. AAA games require massive budgets and don't make nearly as much profit. They are risky investments which rely heavily on studios in the US, Europe, and Japan. All of which have higher costs of living and as a result the employees have much higher pay. To subsidize this and get more profit these companies are turning to microtransactions and re-use of older assets to gain profits. 

Fortnite is a classic example of this. Free to play game. Skins cost anywhere from $8 to $20. There's a $10 battle pass. The game is mostly re-used assets from moderately popular ""Save the World"" version of Fortnite. Of course this game makes record profits. Companies like Activision-Blizzard, Ubisoft, EA, Bethesda, Take Two, and Nintendo are trying to cash in on this. Activ-Blizz is trying to over-monetize Destiny 2. They are making the Diablo phone game cash grab. They have made money hand over fist through Overwatch and its lootboxes. EA has its swath of microtransactions in games as does Ubisoft. Bethesda is going the same route with Fallout 76 and Elder Scrolls Blades. Take-Two is constantly using sports games with minimal effort and changes just like EA with Fifa. GTA Online is insultingly manipulative. Nintendo has even fallen to this with their mobile games. Just look at Animal Crossing Pocket Camp's horrid implementation. 

Basically the market is changing and what we consider to be ""good video games"" are being replaced by shitty free to play games with microtransactions to maximize profit.",1546535819,1,1546532219.0,Fifa,0.0153365545

Ultimate.

Have I forgotten anything? Wasn't there a new Yakuza game for PS4?

But on the PC side we got:
- Battlefield V (release was bad, but it's still a pretty good game, that also looks insanely good on PC if you have the hardware)
- Hitman 2 (feels a bit overlooked this year)
- CoD: BO4
- FarCry 5
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Monster Hunter: World
- Sea of Thieves
- Forza Horizon 4
- Sports games like Fifa
- Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Dragon Ball FighterZ (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Soulcalibur VI (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Hunt Showdown (maybe, it's still early access)

There are also some games with not the best reception like State of Decay 2, The Fallout game that shall not be named, etc.

In addition we have our constantly updated games, that are very big on PC too: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, DotA2, Warframe, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. (even Warcraft 3 got some love)

For me it was an amazing year as a PC gamer.

923,137,Eurehetemec,"&gt; Did McDonald's offer healthy choices because they were legislated to do so, or was their demand from the consumer for a healthy option and McDonald's responded?

Both. In the UK, for example, they were faced with legislation, and acted before it came in, but have also been faced with responding to legislation. They looked at which way the wind was blowing.

Again your bad analogy is helpful to my argument, though, because even if it was demand from the customer then see below:

&gt; If you don't like or agree with the gambling features, don't buy the game. See how fast they would sell a version without that if it started to effect their bottom line.

These are licensed sports game. Not just ""games"". They sell specifically because they're officially licensed. Let's take the license away from EA, and see how well they sell with the UT shit, how about that? A huge proportion of the sales are to young fans of the sport, who just want the ""official"" game.

Even we go with your factually-incorrect implication that it was purely customer demand that changed McDonald's, the customers don't really have another option here. If they want to play a football game with the correct, real-world teams and players and so on, they pretty much have to buy FIFA or nothing at all, and most of them, being football fans, grin and bear it.

So your analogy here would be, say, that McDonald's was literally the only place which was allowed to sell beef burgers, everywhere else had to sell soy or lamb or chicken or whatever.

I can see you're having some trouble processing this intellectually, given the weak and context-less arguments and bad analogies you're using.

Nice backpedal. ""Valuing personal accountability"" is not at all the same thing as:

You don't ""value"" personal accountability, you put absolutely everything on it and discount everything else. Normal people value personal accountability, but they don't believe it's ""100%"" (and no-one forced you to use such a horseshit number) on consumers, many of whom are children.

To set expectations correctly here: I am not saying positively, affirmatively, that the Frostbite engine ""doesn't"", or ""can't"" run on the Switch. I'm specifically saying that this article, and the source cited, are confirming *nothing*. It's barely anything more than a rumor based on this.

To clarify something here, ""SDK"" is a term that can be given broad usage. I've worked on SDKs for game companies before - not AAA ones - but it did not commonly refer to the game's engine. In fact I would expect someone to use that term directly if the graphics pipeline or entity capabilities were something they were coding for. SDKs more commonly refer to a set of tools to access online services. Say EA has a dozen games that use online matchmaking; they could all very likely use the same SDK, connecting to the same backend to provide leaderboards, matchmaking, or even player analytics like number of times booted up. This could even mean an indie team making a small multiplayer game for EA could connect to their SDK even when using Unity. Doctre81 mentions FIFA was on Switch, which could very well be the one game they ported some sort of SDK for.

Plus, this could be simply a confirmation that this engineer successfully completed work that was not used. Say his work was on a UI toolkit - he may have very successfully ported that toolkit from PS4 to the Switch - and then two months later, it is very possible for the leads to say ""All right, well, the business/tech/licensing side is not looking good, so we're cancelling plans to develop a game for the Nintendo Switch."" This very sort of thing has happened to me in my work - successfully completing a useful tool that then no longer matches what the company is going for. What's more, an engineer would be very likely to put this sort of information on his resume - he may have done very good work here that will never be seen as part of a public product.

I also completely disagree that any anger I got from FIFA is because of my parents. I wondered this for years and as I grew up I came to the realisation that FIFA makes me so angry compared to other games because of the lack of control.

Obviously this is just from my experience so it's one view point, just like yours is another. I just think it's worth pointing out that it's really not as simple as you make it out to be.

Where in the past there were considerable distribution costs, publishers, etc. in the middle, in present day you can just write an app/make a game and post it directly to a mobile store with little effort. These games are built using cheap assets, quick and poor coding, and mostly marketing budgets. They are filled to the brim with microtransactions and built to ensnare people. 

These games are incredibly profitable and have an insanely low cost as most of the development takes place in Asia. The sales happen worldwide and in places such as China, the US, and Europe. AAA games require massive budgets and don't make nearly as much profit. They are risky investments which rely heavily on studios in the US, Europe, and Japan. All of which have higher costs of living and as a result the employees have much higher pay. To subsidize this and get more profit these companies are turning to microtransactions and re-use of older assets to gain profits. 

Fortnite is a classic example of this. Free to play game. Skins cost anywhere from $8 to $20. There's a $10 battle pass. The game is mostly re-used assets from moderately popular ""Save the World"" version of Fortnite. Of course this game makes record profits.

GTA Online is insultingly manipulative. Nintendo has even fallen to this with their mobile games. Just look at Animal Crossing Pocket Camp's horrid implementation.

Atlas is different enough to be a stand alone game.

Counter-Strike started as a Half-Life Mod, Mario Party only adds a few more boards and minigames each time. Smash Bros just upgrades the graphics each time.

Atlas is early acces, it‘s basically a playable alpha/beta. They told us so before release. They said Early Access would go on for two years. 
They never said it was going to be a smooth as a baby‘s butt full release experience.
It‘s an ‚MMO‘. Stuff breaks, servers are gonna be packed. There isn‘t a single MMO game that hyped that launched without a hitch.
Diablo 3 had Error 37, WoW had hour long queues for each server, Bless online was worse than any launch ever and people still played it. Even Wildstar (rip) had problems at launch.

Why should Atlas be any different? 
What did you expect?
Think before you buy, stop acting on impulses. 

I spent 40 hours in Atlas so far. I refunded Ark two times. It is not Ark. Ark is a hot pile of garbage compared to Atlas.

978,192,Django117,"It's profitable to be an asshole. The issue is that video games have changed due to the mobile market. Where in the past there were considerable distribution costs, publishers, etc. in the middle, in present day you can just write an app/make a game and post it directly to a mobile store with little effort. These games are built using cheap assets, quick and poor coding, and mostly marketing budgets. They are filled to the brim with microtransactions and built to ensnare people. 

These games are incredibly profitable and have an insanely low cost as most of the development takes place in Asia. The sales happen worldwide and in places such as China, the US, and Europe. AAA games require massive budgets and don't make nearly as much profit. They are risky investments which rely heavily on studios in the US, Europe, and Japan. All of which have higher costs of living and as a result the employees have much higher pay. To subsidize this and get more profit these companies are turning to microtransactions and re-use of older assets to gain profits. 

Fortnite is a classic example of this. Free to play game. Skins cost anywhere from $8 to $20. There's a $10 battle pass. The game is mostly re-used assets from moderately popular ""Save the World"" version of Fortnite. Of course this game makes record profits. Companies like Activision-Blizzard, Ubisoft, EA, Bethesda, Take Two, and Nintendo are trying to cash in on this. Activ-Blizz is trying to over-monetize Destiny 2. They are making the Diablo phone game cash grab. They have made money hand over fist through Overwatch and its lootboxes. EA has its swath of microtransactions in games as does Ubisoft. Bethesda is going the same route with Fallout 76 and Elder Scrolls Blades. Take-Two is constantly using sports games with minimal effort and changes just like EA with Fifa. GTA Online is insultingly manipulative. Nintendo has even fallen to this with their mobile games. Just look at Animal Crossing Pocket Camp's horrid implementation.

With a FPS, you have a clear way of defining them as such.  The same goes for pretty much every other genre aside from those that fall on the RPG spectrum.  Real time strategy games are clearly games in which you engage in strategic opposition to one or more forces in real time.  Sims are clearly games that try to simulate some sort of activity.  Sports games are games in which you play sports.  And so on and so forth.

But what is a JRPG?  Any game labeled as an RPG made by a Japanese developer?  So does that make Dark Souls, Bravely Default and The Last Remnant all the same genre?  What is the difference between an action RPG  and an action/adventure game?  Why do some RPGs let you roleplay while others have you follow a story?  Why are Diablo and Mass Effect in the same genre, but Mass Effect and Just Cause in different ones?

You may not *like* that RPGs don't have a clear gameplay-centric definition, but they simply don't.  You can go down the maddening, self-defeating route of being a ""purist"" and declaring that anything that doesn't fit your criteria for an RPG isn't one, but that isn't going to stop people from giving their games that label, and it won't benefit you in any way outside of an Excel sheet you use to keep track of what games are ""real"" RPGs.

The other possibility is to look at the games that carry the label and see what they have in common, and what they have in common is tradition.

But there's another thing these games badly need, and in fact it's something that most racing sims, even Assetto Corsa and Rfactor 2 need.

**Atmosphere**

Here's what I mean. In Nascar Thunder 2003, you'd start a race, but it wouldn't just be starting a race. You'd hear the MRN announcers talk about what's going to happen and speculate on the drivers, you'd hear the national anthem, and you'd even see planes fly over.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INiatwCUajY

This sort of atmosphere also extends to the Codemasters F1 series of games, where you see animations of pit crew people looking at computer screens with scrolling car data, the two announcers would comment on the upcoming race, and you'd even have your crew with you on the grid just before the warm up lap.

Now, I know that they also have to put work into physics, and getting all those guys into studios to record lines and having animations made for the daytona 500 and the indy 500 and stuff would take time, but I truly miss the days when a racing game would try to sell me on the excitement of an upcoming race and make me feel like I'm there by putting in a buildup and making me feel like there's a genuine buzz and excitement around the race I'm competing in.

I mean, imagine going to the Goodwood Festival Of Speed in one of these games, competing in the timed hillclimb, but then also having the option to watch the rest of the competitors and also being able to watch the airshow that happens on one of the days there. Imagine being able to walk around the pits and see not only your car, but the various pre-war and historic and modern cars the other racers brought there. Even if they're just AI racers, there's no doubt that that would be cool as hell.

But even if you don't go that far, at least the illusion of simulated TV coverage would be a good step. Again, note Nascar Thunder 2003, with that race buildup of the national anthem and the planes flying over.

Project Cars and Assetto Corsa feel so much more immersive. Vox Machinae feels like you're actually piloting a mech.

I think I can summarize my sentiment in this: if my VR headset broke, I'd immediately buy another one in the $200 range. I don't want to play those games without VR anymore.

1000,16,ScarsUnseen,"That's what happens when you use the same label for 40+ years of evolving game design.  Imagine if everything from Kings X to Bloodbath fell under the term ""hard rock"" because the music industry kept trying to lazily use a single genre label for everything that evolved out of AC/DC and other bands of that era.  

There *is* no common core gameplay loop for RPGs.  There's no unifying design goal for them.  There's no universal gameplay mechanics.  The only thing that unites all RPGs is the fact that they are inspired by previous RPGs.  And not always in imitation.  Sometimes, like in music genres such as post-metal, RPGs are designed deliberately *counter* to the design of previous games.  But we don't have a ""post-RPG"" genre.

And because early traditional RPG mechanics turn out to be good at padding content, other genres that want to pad content often borrow from the genre.  In most cases, these differ in obvious ways from RPGs(due to some genres like FPS games having relatively clear conventions), but in others, there have been separate lines of design evolution that have converged to make them very close in appearance.  The action RPG genre and the action/adventure genre evolved from entirely different roots, but at this point, they're close enough in nature that adding elements from RPGs to an action/adventure game makes it pretty much indistinguishable from an action RPG.

You can't even say that an RPG is a game in which you can role play because you can roleplay just fine in a non-RPG like The Sims, but then you have RPGs like the mainline Final Fantasy series that are explicitly about you following a prewritten story of pre-established characters.

Each colonist can have a specialized role in your colony, like one can be the cook, another can be a builder and another an artist.

The main thing about games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress that seperates them from games like the Sims is that a lot of random stuff happens that can completely change everything for better or worse. RNG is usually a bad things in games, but in Rimworld it's used to tell a story. For example, the other day I had a colonist pass out from heatstroke in the jungle. While passed out a random monkey goes apeshit and decides it's going to attack him in his vulnerable state. Usually you can wake people up by drafting them for combat, but in this case the guy I was trying to draft had the heavy sleeper trait, meaning I couldn't get him to wake up, he just kept lying on the ground. So I decide fuck it, I'm going to send my sniper out there to deal with the monkey. It's too late though, the monkey gets to the guy and attacks him before my sniper could get a shot in. The guy wakes up in a panic and starts running back to base, he runs directly in from of my sniper with the monkey behind him and my sniper accidentally shoots him in the stomach. At the end of the day, he survived, but it was still a hilarious unscripted situation and that's actually what Rimworld is all about, the stories that the game generates on it's own.",1546787148,1,1546783548.0,The Sims,0.0071119643

1012,28,tameriaen,"I'm being academic here, but the game is very ""system's based"". Absent care for your financial well being, sanity, health, etc -- you will die. The casting of spells and campaigning of expeditions are essentially matrix additions with an element of random chance. You play the game completing abstract actions, building complex structures, and using those structures to enact goals. This is all very sim like, but the interface is minimal/abstract.

Let me give some concrete examples of this (i.e. minimalist simulations) One could correctly call [Spent](http://playspent.org/) a poverty simulation or [Fate of the World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/80200/Fate_of_the_World/) an environmental sim (FotW is effectively a card game). Both are based on real world data, and in both cases, play consists of manipulating variables in the system in order to effect favorable outcomes. Historically, people have used card based games for simulation/training, the [CIA's card game](https://kotaku.com/the-cia-made-a-board-game-and-its-now-playable-1825556825) is a curious example of this. 

Going back to your point, I understand that among (more established) video games, simulators usually refer to visual/interactive systems. I'm arguing that 3D visuals do not a simulation make; rather, its the ability to interact with/manipulate an underlying model that does. How it's presented to the player is more an issue of abstraction (i.e. how elements of the system are shown to the player).

So, I get your point relative to the Sims you listed, but given how system's based the game is, I think the title still fits/describes the gameplay. ",1546985538,1,1546981938.0,The Sims,0.0013947105
1013,29,fatcat_bigwig,"Sure, no problem. Below is something I had written previously awhile back on it, and it’s pretty all subjective of course as to why I think one is better than the other.


-I hate that it has fighting in it, and that the fighting isn't really all that good. It's stressful and was never really something I wanted in these type of games. And it kind of affects a lot of stuff in the game where you'll go ""oops I need gold/copper/etc"" and then you have to go mining to fight monsters which to me is the complete opposite of relaxing.

-The game has some pacing issues for me. Example of this I feel is with the watering can, the game really never gives you any incentive to upgrade the watering can as you pretty much get sprinklers early on. Like each of these being in the game isn't really bad but I feel like if it was paced a bit better the game would have been better for it. It's kind of like that shit in JRPGs where you'll find stuff more powerful off enemies than you do in shops making shops feel kind of useless or are relegated as only your potion shop.

-Traversing the world can be a bit of a chore. Sure you can get a horse but the entire game just felt like constant back tracking. Sure you get the mine cart in the game but I really felt it should have been one of the first few upgrades of the town in the game. Example of what I like better (granted still could be better), was the horse system in Story of Seasons where you could fast travel to points on your map that were stables. I liked that method so much more as it still gave your horse purpose.

-I just straight up hated the art. This one is obviously totally subjective as people have wildly different tastes for art.

-The characters and marriage partners were really lacking. Most of the marriage candidates felt like actual teens and really took me out of the game, and since marriage was a huge motivator in previous games it kind of took the wind out of my sails. For me this like 50% of what makes farming sims fun.

-The town layout is pretty bad. There are way too many choke points to get stuck on as you go through the town, making map traversing even more annoying.

-Pets were kind of useless in the game. I wanted my kitty to have a purpose :(

-They didn't include seed makers in the game that kept the star rating. If you haven't played SoS it's essentially this machine that you can take a gold star crop and it outputs a gold star seed so you don't have any reason to keep fertilizers. Also gold star plants are harder to get in SoS, which I preferred.

I could keep going but I think it covers the scope of the game. The game is very well done for the fact that one person did it by himself which is impressive but because of that I often found myself while playing thinking ""wait..the game doesn't have this??"" or ""why was this done? It doesn't make sense..."".",1546994104,1,1546990504.0,The Sims,0.03763595
1014,30,ScarsUnseen,"I mean, ""action RPG"" has been in the gaming lexicon since at least Diablo 2.  The terms are out there; it's not really the community's fault if the publications won't *use* them.

Personally, I feel that RPG is a genre of traditions more than features.  Any genre can use the same features of an RPG(and these days, many do).  Even the literal interpretation, ""a game in which you role play"" doesn't work because you can role play in practically *any* game, and many non-RPGs are especially conducive to it when they have sim aspects to it like modern sports games and, well, sims.

But an actual RPG doesn't happen by accident.  Every RPG I can think of was created as a comparison to other RPGs.  The first RPGs were inspired by tabletop games.  Successive RPGs were created in ways that deliberately either followed or contrasted from those.  And so on throughout the generations.  Features were added, changed or removed where each developer felt served the game they were making, but every one was created with the intent of making an RPG, and by examining RPGs of the past.

Over time, this split into subgenres where specific games or groups of games became influential enough to draw isolated lines of successors.  JRPGs, roguelikes, dungeon crawlers, isometric RPGs, action RPGs, etc.  But this is different from games that take features they like from RPGs without abandoning their core genre as the primary inspiration.  A sports game is no more an RPG for having character creation and stats than Legend of Legaia is a fighting game for having hand-to-hand combat and combos.

So when trying to determine whether or not a game is an RPG or not, the first thing I would ask is ""does the developer *claim* it's an RPG?""  If so, then I look at the game and see where it drew its inspiration from.  But that first question is important because it informs you of the developers intention, both in the perception of the game and the direction they are likely to take it in the future.

In the case of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft actually labels their game ""Action/Adventure.""  The Steam page has the ""RPG"" tag, but I don't know if they put that there themselves, or if that was just a popular user tag for it.  The actual [Ubisoft Store page](https://store.ubi.com/us/assassins-creed-odyssey) for the game doesn't have it, so I'm basing my opinion on that.  With that in mind, my initial thought is that Assassin's Creed Odyssey isn't an RPG, but rather an action/adventure game with RPG elements.

Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that.  Action/adventure is already so close to the RPG genre in nature that people get them confused all the time and have for decades.  The Legend of Zelda is a prominent example of an action/adventure game that gets referred to as an RPG frequently.  And then if we're adding RPG elements on top of that...  you've pretty much closed the only practical gap between action/adventure and action RPG at that point.

So really, while I would say that by Ubisoft's own declaration of genre, AssCreed Odyssey isn't an RPG(not that they're likely to protest the awards the game gets), I don't think it really matters when the genres involved have that much overlap.

1021,37,OhUmHmm,"&gt; Atari too thought about doing what Stardock did, but quickly settled into paying Toys for Bob royalties.
&gt; 
&gt; That precedent will probably crater Stardocks claims to those bits of IP.

Yes, I agree with this.  The fact that the previous owner didn't fight it in court will probably hurt Stardock.  I vaguely wonder if Stardock didn't do it's due dilligence when purchasing the title for $300,000 but to my knowledge the contract between Stardock and Atari has not been released yet (or maybe it has and I forgot)?  To my knowledge they are still taking it to court, maybe there is a legal argument about Atari being near bankruptcy that made it impossible for them to pursue the issue legally?  But IANAL.

&gt; It's less Tetris making a claim against Lumines, but more like if Lumines creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi who licenced Tetris for Tetris Effect turned around and sold Tetris Effect to Stardock and Stardock started making Tetris clones including similiar colors, shapes, sounds, and music to original 2D tetris. The original licence didn't include that right. Or if Ubisoft turned around and added Mario to Rayman based off the Rabbit's game without consulting nintendo. I doubt the licence included that additional usage.

Is Star Control Origins to Star Control 2 really the same as Tetris Effect to Tetris?  I don't think so.  I would hope most fans of space sims could see the differences vastly outweigh the similarities.  Is Torchlight the same thing as Diablo II?  They have a lot of similarities as well.  But I think of those similarities as genre conventions rather than specific copyright infringement.

Regarding adding Mario to Raymond -- Stardock didn't use any aliens or characters to my knowledge.  This is all about gameplay and some minor points about visual design.  Oh and using the term ""hyperspace"".

I was also very put off by the building due to the fact that vanilla game was limited in where it let you place objects and it took a long time for mods that fixed it to come to PS4. By that time, I didn't care at all about it. It all became very tedious. Not to mention that the building wasn't rewarding at all. You build up a settlement to have it not feel lived in at all, but with mindless Zombies walking around saying the same 3 lines of dialog.

Fallout to me was more about the interesting quests and various different dialog paths that could change any given quest in a multitude of ways. You had a lot more choice in Fallout 3 and NV than you did in Fallout 4. In Fallout 4, the choices are limited by the voice acting so they implemented a pick 1/4 option that still barely gave you any choice. It feels like they watered down the game and expected you to like it because it was more like Minecraft. I don't play Fallout to be distracted from quests to build 80 settlements so I stopped building and realized that most of the quests are just on a grindy combat&gt;loot&gt;scrap loop with no substance. The game was definitely either rushed out the door or watered down to appeal to more casual gamers.

Fallout 4 in my honest opinion is more akin to The Sims or a first person version of Fallout Shelter.

Numbers vary by release, but that's way below average. Average is 1-5%, roughly. [*Helium Rain* had 14% on Linux at one point](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-developer-of-helium-rain-gave-an-update-on-their-sales-low-overall-sales-but-a-high-linux-percentage.11630/), and [*Thimbleweed Park* did well on Mac and Linux combined](https://twitter.com/grumpygamer/status/858387467187101696), on the opposite end of the scale.

My advice to developers has been that if they can deliver Mac and Linux ports in a combined effort for less than 4-5% total development cost, the baseline assumption is that they should do it and will make normal margin on the sales. If development cost would exceed that, I'd recommend against it, normally. Genre can make a difference, as some are well-represented on Linux (turn-based anything, space sims and 6DOF, VNs) and some aren't but therefore have less competition (*Souls*-likes, MMORPG, modern JRPG).

To do that, you need to research the technologies that let you build that spaceship.

To do that, you need to build a research table.

To build one you need resources.

To gather those resources, you need pawns.

To keep your pawns alive and healthy, you need to build them a base, with bedrooms, kitchens, storage rooms, plantations, livestock, as well as defensive structures to defend against the wildlife and other colonies who are also trying to escape the planet (and thus trying to steal your resources)

You start with several pawns and go from there.

If you have played the sims, it's the same thing but instead of trying to become rich and famous you are trying to survive and escape the planet.

1046,5,seandkiller,"Alright, well first let me clarify a few things on my stance on the subject and the following comment in general: I fully understand why the time-gating in Warframe exists and accept it, even if I don't like it. I also acknowledge that all builds in the foundry can be rushed if you are impatient like me, and that my qualms with Clan Research are my own doing for deciding to make my own clan rather than join one, or failing that join one of the clans that offer to let you nab the blueprints and leave. I also apologize if this comment comes off in any way as..Venting.

Like you I have almost 600 hours in the game, although I'm only MR12 hitting 13 as I've been neglecting slots. I can understand what you mean by that, but there are a few things I take issue with.

First, just because I can have more making at the same time doesn't mean I don't have to wait. I can have three frames cooking at once, I still have to wait three days to play any of them (Barring the aforementioned rushing, which I personally take no issue with despite most players saying ""Just wait"".) Each new weapon takes twelve hours to make unless you're willing to front the (admittedly cheap once you get in to end-game trading) rush cost. You need three and a half days to make a Frame, at best. Eight hours for something as inconsequential as an item that allows you to breed another dog.

What I'm getting at here is there's waiting no matter how long you play, somewhat frowned-upon mechanic of rushing aside. I'm not saying this is a bad thing; Just pointing out that you are *always* waiting, even if it doesn't feel like you're waiting because you enjoy playing the game and are in no rush to get the things.

Then you have the matter of resources. I honestly don't have a problem with this either, because it's for the most part a game about grinding, but as you noted having tons of resources...The common ones, yes. Things like Alloy Plate, Nano Spores, etc. Then you have Neural Sensors, which I'm personally always strapped for. And then you have the resource that literally doesn't let you make a stockpile *too* big because it decays.

That said, this whole comment of mine is a bit unnecessary, as you're not wrong. As of writing I have 40 items ready to claim, just waiting for me to bother getting the slots to get them. The problem comes when you have *one* thing you're wanting to build, and are looking forward to. But then you have the option of patience or paying to speed it up.

**TL:DR As this was a long-winded mess of a comment on my part:** You're not *wrong*, but just because you can have several things cooking at once and aren't currently strapped for resources doesn't mean you're not technically waiting. The only unacceptable part to me are the Clan Research wait times... Well, that and finishing a frame to see it immediately gets infected. To which I then have to wait another week.",1546929799,1,1546926199.0,Need for Speed,0.97940147

What .ini settings do I need to make?
In TTW 3.2, you no longer need to set the sCharGenQuest ini setting; the TTW_nvse.dll does this for you at runtime. bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles is not needed for TTW 3.2 itself, since all face textures are generated; mods may still need it activated, but be aware that setting it will affect performance. Rather than editing Fallout.ini and FalloutPrefs.ini, TTW instead creates FalloutCustom.ini in \MyGames\FalloutNV\. JIP LN NVSE plugin loads FalloutCustom.ini as a third ini, allowing extra settings to be set without messing with the core ini files. Why is there a ""grass"" setting in an ini otherwise oriented on performance? Fallout 3 set this at 7000. Fallout New Vegas was hard coded at a cap of 3000, but JIP LN plugin removed that hard coded limit, so TTW restored it to its Fallout 3 level.

It was very disappointing because then the same people complain 6 months later when the online is dead.

For me I like pcars2 but I am used to racing games. I have played all the Gran Turismos, I still play GT sport for the online, used to play forza and since the PS1 have been playing the rally and F1 games etc.  I usually play with manual shift and assists off in those games as well. I really have enjoyed the learning and challenege of pcars2 but even I agree with the point that if the game is released on console, unless you put a warning on the box it needs a wheel or you bundle the game with a wheel, then it should be fit for purpose and ready to play on a controller. GT Sport I had to adjust nothing for the controller settings I only had to worry about the car setup and assists. Pcars 2 , which I prefer as a racing game, I had to spend a bit of time messing around with deadzones and sensitivities etc and then you factor in the more detailed and in depth simulation and the sheer number of things on the car you can adjust it can be very hard for casual players to understand when and where the issue is a car setup vs the controller settings. So if they can nail the experience for the casual player using the controller this will be great. It will allow people to focus on the cars and hopefully will allow the game to grow and I have seen it in GT Sport. People play with controller, they do reasonably well and then a lot of people go on to buy wheels because they understand that now the limit is the controller and not the car setup or their ability.

Odyssey was also really good. The best AC since Black Flag.


Hitman 2 was just perfect. I love all new Hitman games. They are really great.

Ok Fallout 76 was a disaster but lets be honest with our self. It was forseeable from 3 miles away. 

Then we also had the first Madden for PC for years (I normaly dont count sport games as blockbusters but in this case its ok). 


Then Yakuza seemed to be really good from what I heared. Forza also. 


Football Manager 2019 is the best FM since at least 2012 so its fine too. 


Far Cry 5 is my favorite Far Cry so far. 




Obviously PC gaming had better years but there are still some gems this year and I have seen way way worse (just remember 2017...)

There are challenging parts of the game but you are never really boxed in by what class you choose to play as -even if sub-optimal, it doesn't mean ""uselessly broken"".  So play what appeals to you.

The game feels larger than it is (well structured) and has a real sense of exploration if you generally ignore wiki walkthroughs (which you really don't need).   

You can ""new game+"" replay the game as many times as you want.  Character customization is also phenomenal.

The most unique and cool feature of DD is the Follower system - You are best off looking up youtube videos talking about it.  I think ACG has a good review of the game that covers it's selling points - but the follower system feels like the best implimentation of making a single player game feel connected to the community.   Other people's custom followers get injected non-intrusively into your game and yours into theirs.   They act as passing wanderers/adventurers (background characters) that can do their own fighting and you yourself can hire them from your own game (and add them to your favorites list etc.).  It's a lot of fun and am very glad I stumbled upon it.   Amazing game and criminally underrated.   Very fun - can be a little grindy but largely only if you are chasing the grind.  I think speed runs clear the game in like 15 minutes -to give you a perspective - but the actual game is maybe, 20 hours or so long on a casually fast playthrough?  I'm not sure.  The game neither feels too short or long and it has a DLC expansion (included with all versions of the game these days) that you can get lost in and feels like the exactly appropriate amount of difficulty for ""end game""  A story I really liked too.  The Voice acting was enjoyable especially some of the characters from the DLC.

It's not heavily narrative driven (in that it's not like the witcher with a ton of dialogue) but the story is told very well, IIRC all lines are voice acted, and the gameplay/action/combat is imo the high point.  On the surface it's simple but the customization of abilities and loadouts is where it really shines.   You feel powerful without the enemies feeling too easy.   The bosses and mini-bosses feel like the ""Core"" of the gameplay and are plentiful.   ""easy to play - fun to master"" instead of ""hard"" - but it's not a pushover either.

1054,13,SubstantialDrawing,"I'm late to the dicusssion so nobody will see this but I'm shocked that nobody talks about the story also being an issue. I understand the game flaws with the open world and what is said in the article but nobody ever talks about how a slap in the face the story is.

First of all, Arthur getting &gt;!T.B!&lt; is completely forced as hell. You have no option to avoid beating Thomas Downes when originally the game starts off with you getting the option to be good, and or bad which is shown by not killing Jimmy if you don't want to but if you decide you want to, you can drop him off the cliff.

The &gt;!T.B!&lt; narrative also pisses me the fuck off because it becomes completely contradictory. At the beginning of the game Dutch and the gang preach Robin Hood inspired motto's .. Even Arthur has a scrap piece of paper which goes back to their first roberry where they gave money back to the poor and that they don't take from the poor. They then introduce this weird plot where Arthur is traumatized because of the killing of Eliza and Issac who were robbed over $10 they did not have. Yet this all becomes utterly pointless when Strauus (who is also a completely pointless character) tells Arthur to go see Thomas Downes. Arthur ends up beating the living shit out of him. A complete replay of what happens to Issac and Eliza but instead of $10, he's doing it all for a meer $30. He doesn't kill them, but he did speed up Downes upcoming death day. Which makes *no* sense considering Arthur bitches at Sadie for wanting to rob a general store owner who's ""just barely getting by."" Yet he will beat the shit out of an ill poor man who asked for more time for absolutely no reason despite the hypocrisy and contradictory which is Issac and Eliza, bitching at Sadie and the Robin Hood motto narrative.

The worst part is, you can't avoid it. You have the option to threaten but the game instantly forces you into beating him with blood all over you, what the fuck? What's the point of ""deciding"" if you want to be good or bad if you can't? You can't even wear a bandanna making it all forced.

To top it off they introduce so many characters that aren't utilized that you instantly end up forgetting. What the hell is the point of Reverend? You just forget about him. They then end it all by giving Arthur a complete cliche predictable Hollywood ending (instead of riding into the sunset you're overlooking the sunrise and dying lol) rather than giving him a temporarily one like John which would make more sense. The ending feels forced because it's all done in vain. They introduce bad blood between Arthur and John at the beginning for several chapters than instantly it's ""I want to help you John, we're brothers. You're all I care about."" Like what? Forgetting that Arthur also cares about the rest of the gang members, but only randomly cares about John, Jack and Abigail when he had bad blood with John for awhile and was willing to let John die if it wasn't Abigail begging him and Javier forcing him.

Don't get me started on Chapter 5 either. Completely filler, took away the open world design and railroads you, filled with glitches. Makes absolutely no sense besides a poor excuse for the gang to lose all their money. New Characters aren't fleshed out and add nothing to the story. Makes no sense. 

Lmao Arthur can take out an entire army with a shitty dusty canon and a warship by himself but he can't survive &gt;!T.B or avoid T.B.!&lt; ???

Makes me sad too because Arthur is already fleshed out and becoming a good person, realizing the world is changing and splitting away from Dutch &gt;!without knowing he has T.B!&lt; So the whole disease narrative wasn't even needed. 

So not only is their game system outdated but their continuous repetition of killing off &gt;!protangists is just a bore. Predictable and lazy.!&lt; The excuse ""they need to tie into RD1"" also doesn't make sense considering they open up a big plot hole by letting John go to NA with Sadie when he wasn't.

I'm surprised how the story and these issues with it get overlooked.

1057,16,DFInterkarma,"Hey all! I'm the lead developer of Daggerfall Unity. We're not quite out of pre-alpha yet, but it will be coming up this year (hopefully around June-July-ish). While feature parity with classic is a huge milestone, we still have a long way to go before 1.0. That said, the game is playable from start to finish if you're willing to live with some bugs and a few missing/unrefined features still under development.

In case you're just learning about the project now, I've put together a few blocks of information below to help get up to speed and learn more if you're interested.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Daggerfall Unity?**

Daggerfall Unity is something like a source port of DOS Daggerfall, akin to other projects like OpenMW and ZDOOM. You point it to your local Daggerfall install and play the classic game with modern lighting and controls, smoother frame rates, higher draw distances, many small quality of life features, and extensive mod support. All game systems have been reimplemented from the ground up with a focus on making QoL improvements wherever possible that keep the overall look and feel of classic Daggerfall.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does it work?**

You'll need to provide a clean install of DOS Daggerfall patched to .213 then point Daggerfall Unity to those assets for it to run. Fortunately Daggerfall was released as a free download by Bethesda in 2009 so it's free and fairly easy to put the two halves together. Daggerfall Unity reads the old DOS binaries and imports them at runtime for play. Unmodded Daggerfall Unity looks a lot like classic by design, and because it's reading the same game assets classic uses. You can even play it in low resolution in all its pixelated glory if you like. There are many ways to tailor the game experience (e.g. click to attack, darker dungeons, smaller dungeons) right out of the gate, and if you'd like to enhance the experience even further there are already several mods available for graphics and gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

**How long has it been in development and how much is left to go?**

Development started in late 2014 as Daggerfall Tools for Unity and evolved into its current form around August 2015. I've been building Daggerfall tools for exploring game assets as a hobby since about 2001. While the project started as a solo endeavour, numerous contributors have appeared over the last couple of years to help and we're making rapid progress. All major game systems have been implemented - what's remaining are several individual spells and item effects, as this was the last big system to be built and is still wrapping up. Our roadmap (linked below) has a high-level overview of what has been completed and what's coming up next.

1058,17,CineasOfThessaly,"It does have day and night cycles, but you can set stuff up to work.  So if you need to make bronze bars, you can set them up before bed, and when you wake up, you've got a bunch of bars already made.  I never really felt limited by sleep.  In Stardew Valley, I would hate how I would run out of stamina and slow to a crawl, but in Portia, running out of stamina doesn't affect your speed.  You just can't mine or fight or gather.  But at least you can run home and sleep and set up production queues.  

As for progress, I feel like there's a good amount.  You start with small furnaces, for instance, and then you can get bigger and better ones that can run on their own longer, and you make permanent additions/improvements to the town, like bridges and museums.

1060,19,TheHeadlessOne,"I mostly disagree. Having played about all of the genesis titles and gamegear titles, most of the advance series, and a bit of Rush theres something I want to love in the series, but I feel so often in the early games the level design works against the mechanics. There is a certain sweetspot of speed that you need to hit before you feel like you can really move around reasonably, and every level feature seems designed to break you just short of that speed. Without that base limit of speed, regular platforming isn't very fun to me.

Ill also be the first to admit that I just really don't like games I can't save my progress in- SA3(&amp; Knuckles) is by far my favorite in the series because of saving. But personally, it took until Mania for me to have a Sonic game that finally lived up to its potential, and that's mostly because they hit an excellent balance in stage features that didn't break your momentum but didn't rocket you forward to top speed either",1546317027,1,1546313427.0,Need for Speed,0.9865042
1061,20,cdiganon,"I beat the game but I don't really like it. Most parts were either way too frustrating or way too easy. Had to reload a save at a certain boss because I was way super underpowered and had to came back after leveling up a bunch which would be fine if I wasn't super overpowered up to that point like most powerful monster I could farm was like an insect to me. You'll rarely fight something that matches your power.

 Quests can be confusing sometimes, they ask for items or mob kill count but don't tell you where to find them, I skipped most of them.

 There are also certain things like being late to do a quest or doing quests in wrong order can prevent you from progressing (I don't know how accurate this is, read about it a while ago) or lock certain areas forever. 

Some encounters take a while and one mistake will insta kill you making you have wasted 40 minutes for nothing. 

You'll hate traveling because stamina is low and walking speed is WAY too slow, you'll be encouraged to wear clothes, get stamina perks and have an empty inventory because of this and even doing those don't help much. 

But don't take my word for it.

Also some of the frustrations I have endured are my fault only. Take this as my bloopers section. 

 I forgot how to change pawn behavior and I couldn't find the option anywhere in the menus so I assumed that you can't change it so my ""was supposed to be tank"" pawn stayed behind all fights. You can change it by talking to your pawn in inns, not something you can easily discover yourself since you don't need inns other than class change/upgrades and I didn't go ""I wonder what happens if I talk to my pawn here"".

 I thought ""Save and quit"" option was for ""Save and quit"" so I never clicked on it for a while but it is actually multiple choice and you can save without quitting, so I didn't save in open areas and lost a lot of progress upon death multiple times.",1546973535,1,1546969935.0,Need for Speed,0.0006551573

But there's another thing these games badly need, and in fact it's something that most racing sims, even Assetto Corsa and Rfactor 2 need.

**Atmosphere**

Here's what I mean. In Nascar Thunder 2003, you'd start a race, but it wouldn't just be starting a race. You'd hear the MRN announcers talk about what's going to happen and speculate on the drivers, you'd hear the national anthem, and you'd even see planes fly over.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INiatwCUajY

This sort of atmosphere also extends to the Codemasters F1 series of games, where you see animations of pit crew people looking at computer screens with scrolling car data, the two announcers would comment on the upcoming race, and you'd even have your crew with you on the grid just before the warm up lap.

Now, I know that they also have to put work into physics, and getting all those guys into studios to record lines and having animations made for the daytona 500 and the indy 500 and stuff would take time, but I truly miss the days when a racing game would try to sell me on the excitement of an upcoming race and make me feel like I'm there by putting in a buildup and making me feel like there's a genuine buzz and excitement around the race I'm competing in.

I mean, imagine going to the Goodwood Festival Of Speed in one of these games, competing in the timed hillclimb, but then also having the option to watch the rest of the competitors and also being able to watch the airshow that happens on one of the days there. Imagine being able to walk around the pits and see not only your car, but the various pre-war and historic and modern cars the other racers brought there. Even if they're just AI racers, there's no doubt that that would be cool as hell.

But even if you don't go that far, at least the illusion of simulated TV coverage would be a good step. Again, note Nascar Thunder 2003, with that race buildup of the national anthem and the planes flying over. That would be so cool to see in a project cars game.",1546313901,1,1546310301.0,Need for Speed,0.9624637

With a keyboard, you're either moving at full speed or not moving at all since the keys are just on/off switches, but an analogue control stick let's you be more deliberate and careful. With the exception of a tiny handful of fights and the awful original Ringed City angels, I dunno that having faster camera controls makes up for that.

Granted, this isn't usually very important, but it can be pretty helpful in certain spots, like the rafters in Anor Londo.

I think it really just comes down to preference. Despite being a PC guy for basically my entire life, some games just _feel_ better with a controller, especially if I need extremely fast, easy to press combinations of buttons.

1067,26,seandkiller,"Alright, well first let me clarify a few things on my stance on the subject and the following comment in general: I fully understand why the time-gating in Warframe exists and accept it, even if I don't like it. I also acknowledge that all builds in the foundry can be rushed if you are impatient like me, and that my qualms with Clan Research are my own doing for deciding to make my own clan rather than join one, or failing that join one of the clans that offer to let you nab the blueprints and leave. I also apologize if this comment comes off in any way as..Venting.

Like you I have almost 600 hours in the game, although I'm only MR12 hitting 13 as I've been neglecting slots. I can understand what you mean by that, but there are a few things I take issue with.

First, just because I can have more making at the same time doesn't mean I don't have to wait. I can have three frames cooking at once, I still have to wait three days to play any of them (Barring the aforementioned rushing, which I personally take no issue with despite most players saying ""Just wait"".) Each new weapon takes twelve hours to make unless you're willing to front the (admittedly cheap once you get in to end-game trading) rush cost. You need three and a half days to make a Frame, at best. Eight hours for something as inconsequential as an item that allows you to breed another dog.

What I'm getting at here is there's waiting no matter how long you play, somewhat frowned-upon mechanic of rushing aside. I'm not saying this is a bad thing; Just pointing out that you are *always* waiting, even if it doesn't feel like you're waiting because you enjoy playing the game and are in no rush to get the things.

Then you have the matter of resources. I honestly don't have a problem with this either, because it's for the most part a game about grinding, but as you noted having tons of resources...The common ones, yes. Things like Alloy Plate, Nano Spores, etc. Then you have Neural Sensors, which I'm personally always strapped for. And then you have the resource that literally doesn't let you make a stockpile *too* big because it decays.

That said, this whole comment of mine is a bit unnecessary, as you're not wrong. As of writing I have 40 items ready to claim, just waiting for me to bother getting the slots to get them. The problem comes when you have *one* thing you're wanting to build, and are looking forward to. But then you have the option of patience or paying to speed it up.

**TL:DR As this was a long-winded mess of a comment on my part:** You're not *wrong*, but just because you can have several things cooking at once and aren't currently strapped for resources doesn't mean you're not technically waiting. The only unacceptable part to me are the Clan Research wait times... Well, that and finishing a frame to see it immediately gets infected. To which I then have to wait another week.",1546929799,1,1546926199.0,Need for Speed,0.97940147

What .ini settings do I need to make?
In TTW 3.2, you no longer need to set the sCharGenQuest ini setting; the TTW_nvse.dll does this for you at runtime. bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles is not needed for TTW 3.2 itself, since all face textures are generated; mods may still need it activated, but be aware that setting it will affect performance. Rather than editing Fallout.ini and FalloutPrefs.ini, TTW instead creates FalloutCustom.ini in \MyGames\FalloutNV\. JIP LN NVSE plugin loads FalloutCustom.ini as a third ini, allowing extra settings to be set without messing with the core ini files. Why is there a ""grass"" setting in an ini otherwise oriented on performance? Fallout 3 set this at 7000. Fallout New Vegas was hard coded at a cap of 3000, but JIP LN plugin removed that hard coded limit, so TTW restored it to its Fallout 3 level.

It was very disappointing because then the same people complain 6 months later when the online is dead.

For me I like pcars2 but I am used to racing games. I have played all the Gran Turismos, I still play GT sport for the online, used to play forza and since the PS1 have been playing the rally and F1 games etc.  I usually play with manual shift and assists off in those games as well. I really have enjoyed the learning and challenege of pcars2 but even I agree with the point that if the game is released on console, unless you put a warning on the box it needs a wheel or you bundle the game with a wheel, then it should be fit for purpose and ready to play on a controller. GT Sport I had to adjust nothing for the controller settings I only had to worry about the car setup and assists. Pcars 2 , which I prefer as a racing game, I had to spend a bit of time messing around with deadzones and sensitivities etc and then you factor in the more detailed and in depth simulation and the sheer number of things on the car you can adjust it can be very hard for casual players to understand when and where the issue is a car setup vs the controller settings. So if they can nail the experience for the casual player using the controller this will be great. It will allow people to focus on the cars and hopefully will allow the game to grow and I have seen it in GT Sport. People play with controller, they do reasonably well and then a lot of people go on to buy wheels because they understand that now the limit is the controller and not the car setup or their ability.

Then we also had the first Madden for PC for years (I normaly dont count sport games as blockbusters but in this case its ok). 


Then Yakuza seemed to be really good from what I heared. Forza also. 


Football Manager 2019 is the best FM since at least 2012 so its fine too. 


Far Cry 5 is my favorite Far Cry so far. 




Obviously PC gaming had better years but there are still some gems this year and I have seen way way worse (just remember 2017...)


2017: Had car crashes like For Honor, Need for Speed, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3, CoD WWII, SW Battlefront II, ^Spellforce 3 (decent at best)



And some decent - good games: Like Sniper Elite 4, Divinity: Original Sin II, Wildlands, Tekken 7, Project Cars, TW: Warhammer II (though I really dont like the Warhammer universe), Origins, Wolfenstein II, Destiny 2, 


Like overall I dont think 2017 was in anyway better then 2018...

1074,33,SubstantialDrawing,"I'm late to the dicusssion so nobody will see this but I'm shocked that nobody talks about the story also being an issue. I understand the game flaws with the open world and what is said in the article but nobody ever talks about how a slap in the face the story is.

First of all, Arthur getting &gt;!T.B!&lt; is completely forced as hell. You have no option to avoid beating Thomas Downes when originally the game starts off with you getting the option to be good, and or bad which is shown by not killing Jimmy if you don't want to but if you decide you want to, you can drop him off the cliff.

The &gt;!T.B!&lt; narrative also pisses me the fuck off because it becomes completely contradictory. At the beginning of the game Dutch and the gang preach Robin Hood inspired motto's .. Even Arthur has a scrap piece of paper which goes back to their first roberry where they gave money back to the poor and that they don't take from the poor. They then introduce this weird plot where Arthur is traumatized because of the killing of Eliza and Issac who were robbed over $10 they did not have. Yet this all becomes utterly pointless when Strauus (who is also a completely pointless character) tells Arthur to go see Thomas Downes. Arthur ends up beating the living shit out of him. A complete replay of what happens to Issac and Eliza but instead of $10, he's doing it all for a meer $30. He doesn't kill them, but he did speed up Downes upcoming death day. Which makes *no* sense considering Arthur bitches at Sadie for wanting to rob a general store owner who's ""just barely getting by."" Yet he will beat the shit out of an ill poor man who asked for more time for absolutely no reason despite the hypocrisy and contradictory which is Issac and Eliza, bitching at Sadie and the Robin Hood motto narrative.

The worst part is, you can't avoid it. You have the option to threaten but the game instantly forces you into beating him with blood all over you, what the fuck? What's the point of ""deciding"" if you want to be good or bad if you can't? You can't even wear a bandanna making it all forced.

To top it off they introduce so many characters that aren't utilized that you instantly end up forgetting. What the hell is the point of Reverend? You just forget about him. They then end it all by giving Arthur a complete cliche predictable Hollywood ending (instead of riding into the sunset you're overlooking the sunrise and dying lol) rather than giving him a temporarily one like John which would make more sense. The ending feels forced because it's all done in vain. They introduce bad blood between Arthur and John at the beginning for several chapters than instantly it's ""I want to help you John, we're brothers. You're all I care about."" Like what? Forgetting that Arthur also cares about the rest of the gang members, but only randomly cares about John, Jack and Abigail when he had bad blood with John for awhile and was willing to let John die if it wasn't Abigail begging him and Javier forcing him.

Don't get me started on Chapter 5 either. Completely filler, took away the open world design and railroads you, filled with glitches. Makes absolutely no sense besides a poor excuse for the gang to lose all their money. New Characters aren't fleshed out and add nothing to the story. Makes no sense. 

Lmao Arthur can take out an entire army with a shitty dusty canon and a warship by himself but he can't survive &gt;!T.B or avoid T.B.!&lt; ???

Makes me sad too because Arthur is already fleshed out and becoming a good person, realizing the world is changing and splitting away from Dutch &gt;!without knowing he has T.B!&lt; So the whole disease narrative wasn't even needed. 

So not only is their game system outdated but their continuous repetition of killing off &gt;!protangists is just a bore. Predictable and lazy.!&lt; The excuse ""they need to tie into RD1"" also doesn't make sense considering they open up a big plot hole by letting John go to NA with Sadie when he wasn't.

I'm surprised how the story and these issues with it get overlooked.

1077,36,DFInterkarma,"Hey all! I'm the lead developer of Daggerfall Unity. We're not quite out of pre-alpha yet, but it will be coming up this year (hopefully around June-July-ish). While feature parity with classic is a huge milestone, we still have a long way to go before 1.0. That said, the game is playable from start to finish if you're willing to live with some bugs and a few missing/unrefined features still under development.

In case you're just learning about the project now, I've put together a few blocks of information below to help get up to speed and learn more if you're interested.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Daggerfall Unity?**

Daggerfall Unity is something like a source port of DOS Daggerfall, akin to other projects like OpenMW and ZDOOM. You point it to your local Daggerfall install and play the classic game with modern lighting and controls, smoother frame rates, higher draw distances, many small quality of life features, and extensive mod support. All game systems have been reimplemented from the ground up with a focus on making QoL improvements wherever possible that keep the overall look and feel of classic Daggerfall.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does it work?**

You'll need to provide a clean install of DOS Daggerfall patched to .213 then point Daggerfall Unity to those assets for it to run. Fortunately Daggerfall was released as a free download by Bethesda in 2009 so it's free and fairly easy to put the two halves together. Daggerfall Unity reads the old DOS binaries and imports them at runtime for play. Unmodded Daggerfall Unity looks a lot like classic by design, and because it's reading the same game assets classic uses. You can even play it in low resolution in all its pixelated glory if you like. There are many ways to tailor the game experience (e.g. click to attack, darker dungeons, smaller dungeons) right out of the gate, and if you'd like to enhance the experience even further there are already several mods available for graphics and gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

**How long has it been in development and how much is left to go?**

Development started in late 2014 as Daggerfall Tools for Unity and evolved into its current form around August 2015. I've been building Daggerfall tools for exploring game assets as a hobby since about 2001. While the project started as a solo endeavour, numerous contributors have appeared over the last couple of years to help and we're making rapid progress. All major game systems have been implemented - what's remaining are several individual spells and item effects, as this was the last big system to be built and is still wrapping up. Our roadmap (linked below) has a high-level overview of what has been completed and what's coming up next.

1079,38,TheHeadlessOne,"I mostly disagree. Having played about all of the genesis titles and gamegear titles, most of the advance series, and a bit of Rush theres something I want to love in the series, but I feel so often in the early games the level design works against the mechanics. There is a certain sweetspot of speed that you need to hit before you feel like you can really move around reasonably, and every level feature seems designed to break you just short of that speed. Without that base limit of speed, regular platforming isn't very fun to me.

Ill also be the first to admit that I just really don't like games I can't save my progress in- SA3(&amp; Knuckles) is by far my favorite in the series because of saving. But personally, it took until Mania for me to have a Sonic game that finally lived up to its potential, and that's mostly because they hit an excellent balance in stage features that didn't break your momentum but didn't rocket you forward to top speed either",1546317027,1,1546313427.0,Need for Speed,0.9865042
1080,39,Racecarlock,"So, they're going to use sound and game feel to increase the satisfying feedback you get from driving? Cool, cool.

But there's another thing these games badly need, and in fact it's something that most racing sims, even Assetto Corsa and Rfactor 2 need.

**Atmosphere**

Here's what I mean. In Nascar Thunder 2003, you'd start a race, but it wouldn't just be starting a race. You'd hear the MRN announcers talk about what's going to happen and speculate on the drivers, you'd hear the national anthem, and you'd even see planes fly over.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INiatwCUajY

This sort of atmosphere also extends to the Codemasters F1 series of games, where you see animations of pit crew people looking at computer screens with scrolling car data, the two announcers would comment on the upcoming race, and you'd even have your crew with you on the grid just before the warm up lap.

Now, I know that they also have to put work into physics, and getting all those guys into studios to record lines and having animations made for the daytona 500 and the indy 500 and stuff would take time, but I truly miss the days when a racing game would try to sell me on the excitement of an upcoming race and make me feel like I'm there by putting in a buildup and making me feel like there's a genuine buzz and excitement around the race I'm competing in.

I mean, imagine going to the Goodwood Festival Of Speed in one of these games, competing in the timed hillclimb, but then also having the option to watch the rest of the competitors and also being able to watch the airshow that happens on one of the days there. Imagine being able to walk around the pits and see not only your car, but the various pre-war and historic and modern cars the other racers brought there. Even if they're just AI racers, there's no doubt that that would be cool as hell.

But even if you don't go that far, at least the illusion of simulated TV coverage would be a good step. Again, note Nascar Thunder 2003, with that race buildup of the national anthem and the planes flying over. That would be so cool to see in a project cars game.",1546313901,1,1546310301.0,Need for Speed,0.9624637

1082,1,happyscrappy,"Talks about how great NBA Street is, shows clips from NBA Street, Vol 3 (at the start). Makes no sense.

Also, he calls these ""street"" but then really talks about Big.

Then he says the street games just weren't making any changes between versions, only incrementing the number. Somehow missing that NBA Street, Vol 3 suffered because it changed too much, not too little. Heck, it was NBA Street, Vol 2 that was closest to just a ""track"" pack. And you know what? That didn't matter, Vol 2 was the best because it didn't mess up what was there.

I don't disagree at all that Big suffered because EA expected so much from it. When I walked into E3 and EA was running the SSX3 trailer inside that cylinder at their mammoth booth right by the door it hammered home how much EA had riding on this.

But I don't know if overall I agree with all the details of his story. The ""Silver Bullet"" thing and it disappearing is interesting until you consider that NBA Street, Vol 2 was just basically NBA Jam with polys. It wasn't some far flung thing no one knew the market for. It wasn't, for example, Mirror's Edge.

I think he's right, EA wanted bigger titles. And so ""putting all their wood behind one arrow"" by dropping alternate sports titles seemed logical. I also think the NBA and NFL were at the time rather sensitive to the idea of their sports and, how do I put this sensitively, a perception they were going ""hood"". I'm not saying they should have been, but let's just say if you made all your money off licenses then it probably was easier to drop your ""street"" games instead of fighting the licensors for the rights to release them.

Add all this up, and yeah, EA surely slimmed their offerings down, killing the games that were the furthest from the middle of the road. And it did mean we lost out on some fun ""arcade"" sports games. But I'm sure part of this was games like NBA Street were big-time for couch multiplayer. And couch multiplayer just wasn't where it was at on PS3/Xbox One. How much longer would those games have gone on even without Big losing momentum?",1546816457,1,1546812857.0,NFL,0.7509401

In fact, America’s Army is a huge reason I *didn’t* join the service in 2005 when I was heavily considering it after dropping out of college. Was living in a rural area, enlistment bonuses were through the roof and I was just sitting around playing video games on my computer all day. 

I started seeing lots of adds for the game and was already a huge Operation Flashpoint fan, so I decided to check it out. When I booted it up it was probably the most blatant piece of propaganda I had ever witnessed in my life. Every single part of it was suggesting, “Hey, the Army is so cool! Look at all the cool shit you can do!” 

This was also the era that spawned the aggressive TV adds that portray the service as some sort of badass romp through the world wearing night vision goggles and repelling out of helicopters. Seeing the insane barrage of propaganda that took place prior to The Surge completely turned me off to joining the service. I became aware of how disingenuous it was *because* of the propaganda, not in spite of it.

All that being said, AA was a fucking great MP game and I sunk a couple hundred hours into it. 

Hell, the NFL and college football are massive players in spreading pro-military propaganda. The military dumps millions into adds and their respective teams in order to boost recruitment.

Every Halo game feels different. Staggeringly so at times. If you've been around during the entire series's run, you'd know that literally every Halo release is extremely contentious and controversial because of the shifts in mechanics both small and large from title to title. From big changes like nerfing the pistol in Halo 2 or changing equipment to armor abilities from Halo 3 to Reach to small changes like illustrating bullet spread in the HUD through visual reticle expansion or literally any balance patch in any of the games. They all send the Halo community into a vicious blood thirsty stupor. If you yourself aren't willing to define the grand real estate that the umbrella statement ""X game actually feels like Halo"" describes, I'm not sure if one gets to designate what does and doesn't feel like Halo. 

That being said, right now, it's definitely its own thing but if it's closest to any specific title in the series it's Halo 2. Like something between Quake and old Halo. The jump is more akin to Reach, not the 1 1/2 spartan high moon hover it is in Halo 1 and 2, but with plenty of time for some nice air control at the apex. Crouch jumping works just fine which is pretty fantastic. The movement acceleration itself is pretty damn snappy while avoiding the massive levels of ADAD spam that plague existing incarnations of Halo on PC. We're using projectiles instead of hitscan, and we've had it working pretty well. Arguably at its best, landing a shot is more dependable than Halo 3. Hit detection is work in progress right now so depending on what hour of what day someone plays in editor or in the build, it could be fantastic or horrible. Such is the way of development.

Installation 01 doesn't feel quite like any existing Halo, but it doesn't feel like it doesn't belong either. It's not outside of the margins, in my opinion.


Honestly I retract the quake bit, it feels like CS:GO. It feels sourcy, so I guess the quake scent is still there. As much of a Halo tribute i01 is, we aim to inject our own identity into the game. We will have our own original armors and guns and maps. It's a new experience building on the original trilogy, lateral to the direction Halo 4 and on went. We don't seek to be a replacement.

The Wind level pissed me off, story has my attention so far but I don't really have much else to say. Game is fun but I tend to get frustrated and just give up on these kinds of games. 

**Assassins Creed Odyssey**: Still grinding away at this game, around 50% complete, I couldn't tell you anything about the story other than, thrown off ledge, Reunited with (Spoiler) and just grinding away islands and camps. Its fun, if you liked Origins this has better combat, although I don't seem to use the Bow as much as I did in Origins which is a shame. 

**Super Smash Bros Ultimate**: Picking away at World of Light, great game, WOL has difficulty spikes that I didn't know how to spot at first, but now I understand the defense ratings and spirits a bit better. I wish this mode unlocked characters faster it could be so much shorter than it is. 

**Gears of War 4**: I had 5 friends get this, and man is the online fun. Simple, and well balanced. We have a blast playing this and with Gamespass for $1 a month, its a great game to jump in and out of.

**Red Dead Redemption 2**: Finally finished this, great cinematic, acting, story and the BEST NPC's I have ever seen in a game, its not even close. Combat and Traversal is a chore that takes a lot of getting used to. Overall, after finishing the story and thinking about it, its one of the best video-game stories since the Last of Us, I also enjoyed the story more than God Of War (IMO)",1547051491,1,1547047891.0,Battlefield,0.009426677
1100,1,Workframe,"The original developers of the game bought it back and started making big changes that was disliked by one section of the player base at a time, until they drove away basically everyone. 

They added characters with abilities that aren't fun and changed the meta / primary dynamics of game play for Dirty Bomb. 

The one that made me quit was a character with a rocket launcher that fires in 1 second, has fast velocity, can be guided, instagibs you with splash damage in a huge radius and recharges every 35 seconds. 

When that character first released the game was an unplayable mess of people just rocket launching each other. It drastically reduced the skill ceiling of the game since anyone can get easy kills with it a decent percentage of the time they take shots with it.

The other characters they added also really shifted the game away from what made dirty bomb such a high quality title - its smooth, excellent gunplay. They shifted the game more towards abilities, like overwatch. I like overwatch, but I liked dirty bomb before its overwatchification much much more. It became less about shooting and more about character meta. 

For awhile they also killed 8v8 standard (objective move) lobbies, which were my favorite, and forced everyone to play 5v5 matchmaking in the game mode stopwatch, which was my and many others less preferred game mode. The game wasn't very fun with 5v5. The maps felt empty a lot of the time. The action was slowed down significantly. 

By the time they brought 8v8 lobbies back a lot of people had already left. 

The games anticheat does also leave something to be desired, but the skill ceiling will also give new players a sense that they're facing cheaters when people aren't cheating. I was frequently accused of cheating, because I have about 20k hours on FPS games, have won a couple national tournaments and hit finals in a few more. I'm very good at FPS games. Playing against me is not fun for a new player. I have no doubt that many level 1 people who joined my game instead of the level restricted servers (for those lvl 1 to 10) quit playing after one match. They should not have been in a game with me. Matchmaking was supposed to fix that, but the game lacked enough population, and the implementation of matchmaking was bad by making it 5v5 stopwatch only. I genuinely felt guilty at times because I remember what a fun ruining experience it is getting beaten like that, because that was me going 1 and 13 when I first picked up CS 1.4. I didn't start reliably breaking even on my k/d ratio until i got like 800 hours into Battlefield 2. Bf2 let me get a lot more practice in than cs... I spent a lot of time dead just watching everyone else play in CS since I was so bad at it. 

The anti cheat was also not a very good one. EAC is easily defeated. Battleye is much better and catches more people. I saw a few ultra blatant cheaters (think spinbot, instantfire aimbot spinning in circles headshotting everyone) but honestly nothing out of the ordinary for any shooter game. Shooter games in general are easy to cheat on and always have a fair number of cheaters on them. Most are just smart enough to at least pretend to be legitimate or only use ESP/walls

Tl;Dr  The game needed matchmaking, but did it badly when implemented. They removed a less popular game mode called execution completely even though some players preferred it, rather than having it be an option for those who wanted it to join those servers. They forced everyone to play another less popular game mode (stopwatch) , shrunk game sizes from 8v8 to 5v5 for awhile, implemented fun ruining characters with annoying abilities, then removed matchmaking.

They killed the game themselves. The game was steadily ruined after the original DB games bought the game back. I wish they had never come back and never touched it. It was fine and fun before they tried to ""fix"" it.

As an example of what I mean, consider when battlefield 1942 came out. 17 years ago we had 64 player multiplayer naval, aerial, and infantry combat. The average pc had like 1 core at the time and people's internet sucked ass in comparison to today (not that our internet shouldn't be a lot better assuming you're in the U.S. like me but I digress). 

Today we have graphics cards that are many times more powerful, better internet by a longshot, and relatively easy access to processors with greater than 8 cores and the ability to rent cheap server space. And yet most of these advancements seem to be going towards better graphics and matchmaking services. I feel like what we should be saying is more... mid-scale multiplayer experiences, better A.I., games with more simulatory elements but the only games that are really taking advantage are either survival type games or I guess pubg (in regards to common access to server space/more processor cores etc, not ai).

A good example would be people in the battlefield series that would camp their spawn or base, areas very difficult to or just plain unreachable by the opposing team to reach. Admins/mods would warn them to leave that zone, or kill/boot them from the game.

When people would find a server that they liked, ran and played by people they liked, you could join those servers whenever. You knew you were about to get a good experience.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Either way I hope the project leads are rewarded by heaps and bounds for what they did with Anthem's marketing. They were already busy making the game and they made time to do all this by themselves.",1546316265,1,1546312665.0,Battlefield,0.97173035

I've talked about this before in the Dead Space sub, but the math is pretty simple.  We made DS1, and it sold *okay*.  We thought if we made something similar, but polished and taken to the next level, that'd get us a bigger audience (keep in mind these games are expensive to make).  So we did, and again, it sold *okay*.  In our research, people told us that the #1 reason why people bought Dead Space was because it was scary, but the #1 reason why people DIDN'T buy it was because it was scary.

So, making the same game again, but better, wasn't an option.  We had tried that.  We also had this scary/not scary problem.  So our idea was to add in elegantly integrated drop-in/drop-out co-op, because then we'd have the single player game, but also you could bring a friend along, and that would be less scary if you wanted.  Largely I think they succeeded in this and some of the co-op sections are really great.  The game also looks really good.

1136,37,sylinmino,"Yeah that's kinda BS. Like I said, it's decent but has a lot of flaws. If it were up to me:

- Hide GSP for the first 10 matches or so, similar to how a lot of other online systems hide ranking until calibration is done. This will stop people from seeing the crazy erratic movement in early calibration.
- Improve netcode. Just...like...make it more consistent for people in reasonable distances away on the globe. It's definitely not right now, even though it's better than when it started.
- Better check who was the disconnecter, don't punish the guy who's still connected to the online. Disconnecter should count as a loss, disconnectee should automatically win, not get zero GSP gains. I once got disconnected on right when I won, and as a result GSP didn't change. BS.
- Give me quickplay with a friend on another Switch. Give me Battle Arenas with people on the same Switch.
- Bring taunts back for quickplay. Teabagging right now is ironically more toxic because we don't have taunts. Just do what was done in Smash 4 and impose a taunt limit.
- Restrict Timing options for certain Stock setups. Expand stage selection for Stage setups. Easiest addition: add the selector for Omega &amp; Battlefield (not either or), which for some reason is in regular Smash mode rules but not there.

But even with those faults, I'm still having a blast in online 1v1s for the most part and am consistently getting better.

1139,40,r0botosaurus,"Let me preface this by saying that I have no idea if DQXI will change your mind about the series, but you might just like this one anyways.

So as everyone else has said, yes DQXI plays like a standard, old-school JRPG. Mostly. There's some new additions to the formula this time around, though it's all stuff that's been in other JRPG's. For instance:

* In battle there's a chance a character will become powered up for a random number of turns. They'll be stronger in the main stats, and specific stats that are unique to them specifically (Sylvando gets a buff to his charm, Veronica gets a buff to magical might, etc.) , and if multiple party members are in this buffed state, you can use a powerful ability at the cost of ending the buff.

* There's skill trees for each character and multiple ways to build each character. For instance, Erik can use daggers (eventually learning to dual wield them), or he can use swords, or he can use boomerangs.

*You can also switch party members out in battle as often as you want (although the character who gets swapped in won't be able to move until the next turn).

* There's also a battle mode where you can move characters around the battlefield on their turn and position them where you want. This doesn't affect anything, but it's just nice.

So yes, there's improvements to the battle system from previous games. It's nothing genre-changing, but it all works so well together and feels so good, and that's the point I want to try to make. I could go on about the story and the characters  (legit tho this game has some of my favorite characters in the entire series) or the world and the battles and the Draconian Quest options, and all that stuff, but what's harder to quantify and explain is just how *good* it feels to play this game. I really can't put my finger on what exactly makes this game an absolute joy to play, but it's managed to pull me in much faster than previous games in the series have, and hold onto me for much longer as well. Everything in this game works so well together it's honestly stunning. Every character has unique animations in battles and in cutscenes that fit their personalities so well, the voice acting fits each character so perfectly I can't imagine them being voiced any differently, the world is vibrant and beautiful and realistic but somehow the goofy monster designs don't clash with it, each city is fun to explore and perfectly sized for the story that takes place there, the battle animations are quick but still feel dramatic and weighty... I could go on and on about the minute details and attention that went into this game but suffice to say everything in this game just... **works.**

This game is the culmination of 31 years of perfecting a game series in increments. Unlike another big name JRPG series I could name, Dragon Quest games don't make wild changes in design between games, hoping to catch a current trend and then discarding everything for the next game to catch the next trend. They look at what works and build on it and polish it until it sparkles. Despite coming from a huge publisher and being the 11th mainline game in a massive series, DQXI somehow feels almost handmade because of how perfectly everything works together and how much care went into making it.

This is all a very long-winded way of answering your question. Will you like it? I don't know. I would hope so. If you can appreciate the little things, and if you can appreciate a game that's confident enough in itself to take you at their pace instead of trying to rush you through a dozen action set pieces per hour, then yeah I think you'll like it. Will it change your mind about Dragon Quest? Probably not, but then again it might spark something for you, I can't say for sure. All I can say with full confidence is that Dragon Quest XI is the first game in over a decade that threatens to push Chrono Trigger out of the top position on my list of favorite games of all time.

1146,47,BolsheMick,"While those are all fair points, I wouldn’t call it the popular perception. 

War is worse than hell, as a soldier in WWI (iirc) said, because there are no innocent victims in hell. There are in war. Every modern war and covert operations that fulfill goals a military would be used to achieve (a coup versus an invasion) has seen significant civilian casualties. Even though the leatality of weapons has skyrocketed in the past 100 years, no war comes close to matching how horrific WWI and WWII are because they focus on fronts, on soldiers, who look like young men. They don’t show the 14 year old German conscript who’s executed by Russian soldiers. They don’t show that kid’s older brother or dad carrying out a genocide in the Soviet Union, the reason the Soviets are so damn bloodthirsty. They don’t show how infants are murdered. They don’t show what happens to the people who can’t leave - not really. They don’t show how exponentially civilian casualties have increased. By some estimates, the Iraq war has led to a million deaths, not to mention all the instability it caused. Instead, they show the middle-east getting nuked, something generals called for. They mention the death toll, but at the end of the day - the story is just window-dressing for the multiplayer by the time you get past COD:MW. There’s no real history taken into account, so the moral implications are missed. Spec Ops: The Line is a great counter example where what war actually meant in the Middle-East is exemplified by the white phosphorus attack (a war crime) breaks the MC’s brain when he walks among his innocent victims.

CoD doesn’t do that. It’s arcadey. It’s not meant to portray a deep serious message. But war’s a serious topic, and teenage boys aren’t usually serious. They’re also easy to manipulate. If you play the single-player at all, ultimately its most popular game mode - multiplayer - just has two teams facing off. Frequently, one is the Americans, and then there’s The Other. Whatever message there is disappears, and the military in America’s already pro-military society steps in. They’re able to take advantage of it. 

So yes, the story does portray the leadership as corrupt. But is that really what MW2 is remembered for, or its multiplayer. Because I knew exactly no one who gave 2 shits about it except for memes, and I was around the military recruiting age when it came out. I remember how teenaged boys - myself included - though it was bad ass and cool and that the actual military would be pretty bad ass as a troop. 

Call of Duty isn’t unique here either. Battlefield (save with the opening sequence for BF1 - the whole “you’re not expected to survive” was basically how it went st times plus you had to play it) series falls into the same trap. So do most shooters based in the last century). It’s too much, almost terrifying imagining, a video game like CoD or BF makes you commit atrocities? The interactivity would feel uncomfortable if not disturbed by how frequently innocent people were killed. 


But this is more a criticism of history-based shooters and video games in general. ",1546586168,1,1546582568.0,Battlefield,0.0052415584
1147,48,polygonica,"I've been a pretty hardcore PC gamer for about 10 years now (I'm 22). I still game hard, but a lot less.

It's mostly because games aren't my only priority now -- I've branched out. Real life™️ happened. So, games like StarCraft (that require too much investment to maintain the skill level you need to make interesting, non-autopilot decisions) are just too time-consuming to do justice to, and too boring at low levels. Games that waste my time like your average JRPG/Ubisoft open-world game just don't fly any more -- if I have 10 hours a week to play games I'm not going to waste them grinding. 4X games don't even waste my time -- they just take too damn long. I don't hang out out on clan servers any more and chat, because now I socialize over drinks, or on my Discords with my friends, or over board games. Online toxicity is pushing me out of multiplayer games a little bit, too. For one, if I'm playing a game to relax and only get to play two matches in a night, I could spend my entire night being an adult, babysitting my team's emotions instead of kicking back in the groove where I belong. I can always mute people or find a premade party, but it sours my solo queue experience a little now. Secondly, whether I manage ignore it or not, normal people notice -- the immaturity of online gaming culture damages my image by association, which makes it even less appealing to spend most of my free time gaming.

And the last nails in the coffin for me are these: One, most games can't hold a (narrative) candle to a decent movie. I can't give a rat's ass about the plot the average open world or JRPG or David Cage game. Even A Way Out was terrible! Barely any games are at the level of The Last of Us, or Return of the Obra Dinn. Two, because I've played so many, a lot of games are just too easy now (on non-bullet-sponge difficulty levels) or have played out mechanics that can't keep me engaged any more.

I still love and want to love online competitive games despite the time, the toxicity and the trials of training. I enjoy competition, I enjoy being social, and I enjoy the zany one-offs and mechanical depth of going up against human opponents. But thanks to the downsides, I normally play those games pretty casually now.

Similarities: 

* Large open world maps with lots of bases to infiltrate however you want and whatever order you want

* Stealth based gameplay that works very similar to Hitman's detection system

* Action combat when you feel like going balls to the walls, much better than Hitman in this regard

* Unlockable gear, TONS of it, and they all have different functions, they don't just slap a ""Signature Mark 2"" sticker on them. The gear supports your playstyle and you choose what to unlock by researching it.

* Story based in espionage (but confusing and incomplete, even if you're already familiar with the previous games' stories)

* Main character is morally grey, neither truly good nor evil, though some might debate that one way or the other

* Occasional humor and doesn't always take itself as seriously as it seems

Differences:

* No clockwork levels, though some missions do have scripted enemy paths

* No disguises, but lots of camo options that work better or worse depending on your surroundings

* You get to upgrade a huge ocean base

* Kidnap enemy soldiers on the battlefield by attaching balloons to them that get picked up by a jet that transports them back to your base for brainwashing. They then serve you as soldiers, engineers, researchers, and more as you see fit

* Do the same to animals and build a zoo at your base

* Do the same with enemy vehicles, including jeeps, APCs, and tanks

* Unlock four different buddies to support you on your missions, including a horse, a wolf with an eyepatch, a sexy sniper lady, or a miniature walker mech

* Customize and upgrade your own helicopter, using it to support you with airstrikes, vehicle and equipment drops, buddy swaps, and even choose the battle song you want it to play when it arrives

* Infiltrate other player's bases to steal their resources in single player mode (the player who has his resources ""stolen"" doesn't actually lose them, though, so you don't have to worry about it if it happens to you)

* Multiplayer modes with a few different mode types

Instead I got a very unique, captivating experience where I'm trying to figure out what the hell went wrong here and where I'm trying to escape from an invincible, deadly and intelligent foe.

As hyped as I am for AI2, I know it won't ever reach the sales of Call of Duty or ~~Battlefield~~ Madden.

As excellent as the game could ever be, it only appeals to a very small segment of gamers who enjoy very intense and scary experiences. This will always be an issue for these type of games along with games like Silent Hill; they aren't necessarily ""fun"" games, but they are very engrossing and thrilling. 

It's just sad that AAA studios don't want to make these type of games as they don't produce the big bucks as another generic FPS or sports game would. It's discouraging seeing capitalism dictate the production of video games rather than games created by a vision. It's one of the few areas traditional art has a leg up on interactive art.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Either way I hope the project leads are rewarded by heaps and bounds for what they did with Anthem's marketing. They were already busy making the game and they made time to do all this by themselves.",1546316265,1,1546312665.0,Battlefield,0.97173035

1218,119,ThePhilosophersGames,"I think it depends on how much you liked the console exclusives. The only AAA games we didn't get this year were RDR2 (which could come to PC in theory, but Rockstar is doing Rockstar things), God of War, Detroid (which is a pretty special case game, because David De Gruttola aka David Cage) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Have I forgotten anything? Wasn't there a new Yakuza game for PS4?

But on the PC side we got:
- Battlefield V (release was bad, but it's still a pretty good game, that also looks insanely good on PC if you have the hardware)
- Hitman 2 (feels a bit overlooked this year)
- CoD: BO4
- FarCry 5
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Monster Hunter: World
- Sea of Thieves
- Forza Horizon 4
- Sports games like Fifa
- Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Dragon Ball FighterZ (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Soulcalibur VI (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Hunt Showdown (maybe, it's still early access)

There are also some games with not the best reception like State of Decay 2, The Fallout game that shall not be named, etc.

In addition we have our constantly updated games, that are very big on PC too: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, DotA2, Warframe, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. (even Warcraft 3 got some love)

And if that's not enough, the indies (and friends) this year were sick too. Return of the Obra Dinn, Celeste, The Messenger, Dead Cells, Frostpunk, Into the Breach, Ashen, Below, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Banner Saga 3, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, Subnautica, Beat Saber, GRIS, X4: Foundations, Mega Man 11 (not an indie), Wizard of Legend, etc

For me it was an amazing year as a PC gamer. Ofc if you only look at PC exclusive AAA games for PC, then almost every year is a bad year for PC, because PC is an open platform and no deals prevent developers/publishers from releasing their games on other platforms too, so ofc if it's on pc and playable on other systems, then there will be a port at some point. Only few games are left for PC only, often RTS games and alike, because they play better with mouse and keyboard.",1546367310,1,1546363710.0,Battlefield,0.0050597847
1219,120,incipiency,"For the record, Galactic Civilizations 2 is arguably among the best 4x strategy games ever made. Excellent customization, cool factions, tons of gameplay diversity, random events, and AI that's actually good. Like, really good sometimes! If you like that sort of game and haven't played GalCiv2, you're missing out.

GalCiv3 wasn't quite as strong, especially on release, but with each expansion it's been getting closer to the standards set by 2 and I've heard good things about the latest expansion, though I haven't tried it yet myself.

Meanwhile Sins of a Solar Empire is a cool semi-4x/rts kinda hybrid somewhat similar to Paradox strategy games in that instead of turns it's real-time but with adjustable speed and pausing. It's a unique rts that takes place on a massive battlefield that encompasses potentially dozens of solar systems yet surprisingly isn't overwhelming at all once you get used to the UI. It's more about combat than diplomacy or trade, so keep that in mind, but the battles it does exceptionally well with a focus on macro over micromanagement. Great mod community too!

1230,131,r0botosaurus,"Let me preface this by saying that I have no idea if DQXI will change your mind about the series, but you might just like this one anyways.

So as everyone else has said, yes DQXI plays like a standard, old-school JRPG. Mostly. There's some new additions to the formula this time around, though it's all stuff that's been in other JRPG's. For instance:

* In battle there's a chance a character will become powered up for a random number of turns. They'll be stronger in the main stats, and specific stats that are unique to them specifically (Sylvando gets a buff to his charm, Veronica gets a buff to magical might, etc.) , and if multiple party members are in this buffed state, you can use a powerful ability at the cost of ending the buff.

* There's skill trees for each character and multiple ways to build each character. For instance, Erik can use daggers (eventually learning to dual wield them), or he can use swords, or he can use boomerangs.

*You can also switch party members out in battle as often as you want (although the character who gets swapped in won't be able to move until the next turn).

* There's also a battle mode where you can move characters around the battlefield on their turn and position them where you want. This doesn't affect anything, but it's just nice.

So yes, there's improvements to the battle system from previous games. It's nothing genre-changing, but it all works so well together and feels so good, and that's the point I want to try to make. I could go on about the story and the characters  (legit tho this game has some of my favorite characters in the entire series) or the world and the battles and the Draconian Quest options, and all that stuff, but what's harder to quantify and explain is just how *good* it feels to play this game. I really can't put my finger on what exactly makes this game an absolute joy to play, but it's managed to pull me in much faster than previous games in the series have, and hold onto me for much longer as well. Everything in this game works so well together it's honestly stunning. Every character has unique animations in battles and in cutscenes that fit their personalities so well, the voice acting fits each character so perfectly I can't imagine them being voiced any differently, the world is vibrant and beautiful and realistic but somehow the goofy monster designs don't clash with it, each city is fun to explore and perfectly sized for the story that takes place there, the battle animations are quick but still feel dramatic and weighty... I could go on and on about the minute details and attention that went into this game but suffice to say everything in this game just... **works.**

This game is the culmination of 31 years of perfecting a game series in increments. Unlike another big name JRPG series I could name, Dragon Quest games don't make wild changes in design between games, hoping to catch a current trend and then discarding everything for the next game to catch the next trend. They look at what works and build on it and polish it until it sparkles. Despite coming from a huge publisher and being the 11th mainline game in a massive series, DQXI somehow feels almost handmade because of how perfectly everything works together and how much care went into making it.

This is all a very long-winded way of answering your question. Will you like it? I don't know. I would hope so. If you can appreciate the little things, and if you can appreciate a game that's confident enough in itself to take you at their pace instead of trying to rush you through a dozen action set pieces per hour, then yeah I think you'll like it. Will it change your mind about Dragon Quest? Probably not, but then again it might spark something for you, I can't say for sure. All I can say with full confidence is that Dragon Quest XI is the first game in over a decade that threatens to push Chrono Trigger out of the top position on my list of favorite games of all time.

1237,138,BolsheMick,"While those are all fair points, I wouldn’t call it the popular perception. 

War is worse than hell, as a soldier in WWI (iirc) said, because there are no innocent victims in hell. There are in war. Every modern war and covert operations that fulfill goals a military would be used to achieve (a coup versus an invasion) has seen significant civilian casualties. Even though the leatality of weapons has skyrocketed in the past 100 years, no war comes close to matching how horrific WWI and WWII are because they focus on fronts, on soldiers, who look like young men. They don’t show the 14 year old German conscript who’s executed by Russian soldiers. They don’t show that kid’s older brother or dad carrying out a genocide in the Soviet Union, the reason the Soviets are so damn bloodthirsty. They don’t show how infants are murdered. They don’t show what happens to the people who can’t leave - not really. They don’t show how exponentially civilian casualties have increased. By some estimates, the Iraq war has led to a million deaths, not to mention all the instability it caused. Instead, they show the middle-east getting nuked, something generals called for. They mention the death toll, but at the end of the day - the story is just window-dressing for the multiplayer by the time you get past COD:MW. There’s no real history taken into account, so the moral implications are missed. Spec Ops: The Line is a great counter example where what war actually meant in the Middle-East is exemplified by the white phosphorus attack (a war crime) breaks the MC’s brain when he walks among his innocent victims.

CoD doesn’t do that. It’s arcadey. It’s not meant to portray a deep serious message. But war’s a serious topic, and teenage boys aren’t usually serious. They’re also easy to manipulate. If you play the single-player at all, ultimately its most popular game mode - multiplayer - just has two teams facing off. Frequently, one is the Americans, and then there’s The Other. Whatever message there is disappears, and the military in America’s already pro-military society steps in. They’re able to take advantage of it. 

So yes, the story does portray the leadership as corrupt. But is that really what MW2 is remembered for, or its multiplayer. Because I knew exactly no one who gave 2 shits about it except for memes, and I was around the military recruiting age when it came out. I remember how teenaged boys - myself included - though it was bad ass and cool and that the actual military would be pretty bad ass as a troop. 

Call of Duty isn’t unique here either. Battlefield (save with the opening sequence for BF1 - the whole “you’re not expected to survive” was basically how it went st times plus you had to play it) series falls into the same trap. So do most shooters based in the last century). It’s too much, almost terrifying imagining, a video game like CoD or BF makes you commit atrocities? The interactivity would feel uncomfortable if not disturbed by how frequently innocent people were killed.

1238,139,polygonica,"I've been a pretty hardcore PC gamer for about 10 years now (I'm 22). I still game hard, but a lot less.

It's mostly because games aren't my only priority now -- I've branched out. Real life™️ happened. So, games like StarCraft (that require too much investment to maintain the skill level you need to make interesting, non-autopilot decisions) are just too time-consuming to do justice to, and too boring at low levels. Games that waste my time like your average JRPG/Ubisoft open-world game just don't fly any more -- if I have 10 hours a week to play games I'm not going to waste them grinding. 4X games don't even waste my time -- they just take too damn long. I don't hang out out on clan servers any more and chat, because now I socialize over drinks, or on my Discords with my friends, or over board games. Online toxicity is pushing me out of multiplayer games a little bit, too. For one, if I'm playing a game to relax and only get to play two matches in a night, I could spend my entire night being an adult, babysitting my team's emotions instead of kicking back in the groove where I belong. I can always mute people or find a premade party, but it sours my solo queue experience a little now. Secondly, whether I manage ignore it or not, normal people notice -- the immaturity of online gaming culture damages my image by association, which makes it even less appealing to spend most of my free time gaming.

And the last nails in the coffin for me are these: One, most games can't hold a (narrative) candle to a decent movie. I can't give a rat's ass about the plot the average open world or JRPG or David Cage game. Even A Way Out was terrible! Barely any games are at the level of The Last of Us, or Return of the Obra Dinn. Two, because I've played so many, a lot of games are just too easy now (on non-bullet-sponge difficulty levels) or have played out mechanics that can't keep me engaged any more.

I still love and want to love online competitive games despite the time, the toxicity and the trials of training. I enjoy competition, I enjoy being social, and I enjoy the zany one-offs and mechanical depth of going up against human opponents. But thanks to the downsides, I normally play those games pretty casually now.

1262,163,JustinHopewell,"*Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain* has a lot of similarities. 

Similarities: 

* Large open world maps with lots of bases to infiltrate however you want and whatever order you want

* Stealth based gameplay that works very similar to Hitman's detection system

* Action combat when you feel like going balls to the walls, much better than Hitman in this regard

* Unlockable gear, TONS of it, and they all have different functions, they don't just slap a ""Signature Mark 2"" sticker on them. The gear supports your playstyle and you choose what to unlock by researching it.

* Story based in espionage (but confusing and incomplete, even if you're already familiar with the previous games' stories)

* Main character is morally grey, neither truly good nor evil, though some might debate that one way or the other

* Occasional humor and doesn't always take itself as seriously as it seems

Differences:

* No clockwork levels, though some missions do have scripted enemy paths

* No disguises, but lots of camo options that work better or worse depending on your surroundings

* You get to upgrade a huge ocean base

* Kidnap enemy soldiers on the battlefield by attaching balloons to them that get picked up by a jet that transports them back to your base for brainwashing. They then serve you as soldiers, engineers, researchers, and more as you see fit

* Do the same to animals and build a zoo at your base

* Do the same with enemy vehicles, including jeeps, APCs, and tanks

* Unlock four different buddies to support you on your missions, including a horse, a wolf with an eyepatch, a sexy sniper lady, or a miniature walker mech

* Customize and upgrade your own helicopter, using it to support you with airstrikes, vehicle and equipment drops, buddy swaps, and even choose the battle song you want it to play when it arrives

* Infiltrate other player's bases to steal their resources in single player mode (the player who has his resources ""stolen"" doesn't actually lose them, though, so you don't have to worry about it if it happens to you)

* Multiplayer modes with a few different mode types

There's probably a lot more I'm leaving out, it has a lot of gameplay packed into it. It was disappointing from a story perspective to any Metal Gear fan, but it's still great from a gameplay perspective and there's enough similarities between it and the newer Hitman games that you might like it.",1546670095,1,1546666495.0,Battlefield,0.98475546

i got to the first dungeon about 10 hours in i think? the first dungeon itself i needed 3 hours for to finish (but i'm also trying to find every chest and doing every quest etc. so i ran around it several times)

i also like the puzzles a lot i must say. even just trying to find your way to specific spots to get that one chest, that doesn't even have anything special in it. just getting there at all feels great imo.

but i never felt like the game pushed me to do one thing a lot more than others.

i could go on without questing. i could upgrade my gear without grinding enemies and wanting the absolute best things for my character.

leveling is almost not needed at all, as most stats come from items, which are easy to get imo.

and yea as you said, the art is incredible. it is so frkn cute to see your character chuckle, after someone said something funny etc.

the way the character srespond to each other and holy frkn hell the way the story hits at some points. followed by stuff that just makes you burst out laughing.

crazy good game.

my wife sadly doesn't play games like these, so i hope i can find a video on youtube, showing all cutscenes or mainstory ingame stuff, just so i can send that to her.

i am not searching for it yet, because i don't want to get spoiled myself. but once i finished the game, i just have to show her.

As excellent as the game could ever be, it only appeals to a very small segment of gamers who enjoy very intense and scary experiences.

It's just sad that AAA studios don't want to make these type of games as they don't produce the big bucks as another generic FPS or sports game would. It's discouraging seeing capitalism dictate the production of video games rather than games created by a vision. It's one of the few areas traditional art has a leg up on interactive art.

As an example of what I mean, consider when battlefield 1942 came out. 17 years ago we had 64 player multiplayer naval, aerial, and infantry combat. The average pc had like 1 core at the time and people's internet sucked ass in comparison to today (not that our internet shouldn't be a lot better assuming you're in the U.S. like me but I digress). 

Today we have graphics cards that are many times more powerful, better internet by a longshot, and relatively easy access to processors with greater than 8 cores and the ability to rent cheap server space. And yet most of these advancements seem to be going towards better graphics and matchmaking services. I feel like what we should be saying is more... mid-scale multiplayer experiences, better A.I., games with more simulatory elements but the only games that are really taking advantage are either survival type games or I guess pubg (in regards to common access to server space/more processor cores etc, not ai).

""Setup"" games? I'd prefer a persistent server that I, or others, could intentionally join because it's ran by mods or admins who keep special ed' gamers out.

A good example would be people in the battlefield series that would camp their spawn or base, areas very difficult to or just plain unreachable by the opposing team to reach. Admins/mods would warn them to leave that zone, or kill/boot them from the game.

When people would find a server that they liked, ran and played by people they liked, you could join those servers whenever. You knew you were about to get a good experience.

Now, we don't have that anymore.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Either way I hope the project leads are rewarded by heaps and bounds for what they did with Anthem's marketing. They were already busy making the game and they made time to do all this by themselves.",1546316265,1,1546312665.0,Battlefield,0.97173035

Most of my gaming on PC now consists of indie titles that aren't afraid to try something new, or older games that still have a healthy modding scene.

I play the odd big-name title but they're becoming so formulaic and unimaginative. 

All Ubisoft games are basically the same shit and have been since Assassin's Creed 2. Theme-park environments artificially crafted around collectibles and junk loot.

EA just keeps pulling scummy monetisation moves and as a long-time Battlefield fan, the last two got old pretty fucking fast. I barely clocked up 30 hours before I decided I was done. I preferred the older ones.

Diablo 3 was a huge disappointment for me. I can't stand MMO's. MOBAs or Fortnite etc. Then again, I haven't liked a single Blizzard game apart from Diablo 1 and 2, and they weren't developed by Blizzard themselves.

The only AAA games we didn't get this year were RDR2 (which could come to PC in theory, but Rockstar is doing Rockstar things), God of War, Detroid (which is a pretty special case game, because David De Gruttola aka David Cage) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Have I forgotten anything? Wasn't there a new Yakuza game for PS4?

But on the PC side we got:
- Battlefield V (release was bad, but it's still a pretty good game, that also looks insanely good on PC if you have the hardware)
- Hitman 2 (feels a bit overlooked this year)
- CoD: BO4
- FarCry 5
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Monster Hunter: World
- Sea of Thieves
- Forza Horizon 4
- Sports games like Fifa
- Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Dragon Ball FighterZ (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Soulcalibur VI (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Hunt Showdown (maybe, it's still early access)

There are also some games with not the best reception like State of Decay 2, The Fallout game that shall not be named, etc.

In addition we have our constantly updated games, that are very big on PC too: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, DotA2, Warframe, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. (even Warcraft 3 got some love)

And if that's not enough, the indies (and friends) this year were sick too.

For me it was an amazing year as a PC gamer. Ofc if you only look at PC exclusive AAA games for PC, then almost every year is a bad year for PC, because PC is an open platform and no deals prevent developers/publishers from releasing their games on other platforms too, so ofc if it's on pc and playable on other systems, then there will be a port at some point.

GalCiv3 wasn't quite as strong, especially on release, but with each expansion it's been getting closer to the standards set by 2 and I've heard good things about the latest expansion, though I haven't tried it yet myself.

Meanwhile Sins of a Solar Empire is a cool semi-4x/rts kinda hybrid somewhat similar to Paradox strategy games in that instead of turns it's real-time but with adjustable speed and pausing. It's a unique rts that takes place on a massive battlefield that encompasses potentially dozens of solar systems yet surprisingly isn't overwhelming at all once you get used to the UI. It's more about combat than diplomacy or trade, so keep that in mind, but the battles it does exceptionally well with a focus on macro over micromanagement. Great mod community too!

1352,253,usaokay,"Pretty old article understandably reposted. 

I've always been bothered by Call of Duty moving away from the multiple protagonist view (ex. the WW2 and MW games ) and into American-only (ex. [Black Ops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs_a62aOBT0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=833), Ghosts, IW, AW). Yeah, there are other nationalities in those games, but they serve as sidekicks.

Personally, stuff like this is more marketable since I guess American customers are more comfortable/connected with their own kind and they bring in more money. A lot of Battlefield games focus on American plot with Russians and Middle Easterns as bad dudes. Rainbow Six: Siege has way more American maps and operators than any other country.

Due to this marketability, it's no surprise that the US Army is attempting to capitalize on this by getting gamers to go: [""Sign up for a real war! We have better graphics!""](https://youtu.be/TsQFYceNZS8?t=133) [They also have their own eSports team too.](https://www.stripes.com/news/uncle-sam-wants-you-to-play-video-games-for-the-us-army-1.555885)

Most of my gaming on PC now consists of indie titles that aren't afraid to try something new, or older games that still have a healthy modding scene.

I play the odd big-name title but they're becoming so formulaic and unimaginative. 

All Ubisoft games are basically the same shit and have been since Assassin's Creed 2. Theme-park environments artificially crafted around collectibles and junk loot.

EA just keeps pulling scummy monetisation moves and as a long-time Battlefield fan, the last two got old pretty fucking fast. I barely clocked up 30 hours before I decided I was done. I preferred the older ones.

Diablo 3 was a huge disappointment for me. I can't stand MMO's. MOBAs or Fortnite etc. Then again, I haven't liked a single Blizzard game apart from Diablo 1 and 2, and they weren't developed by Blizzard themselves.

Wut? There's still a ton of exclusives, but not really any more than before- most of the exclusives this gen were also exclusives last gen, like Zelda or God of War. There's only been a few additions like Spider-Man and RDR2 (the latter of which is surely coming to PC, albeit at a later date).

&gt;PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles

The only AAA games we didn't get this year were RDR2 (which could come to PC in theory, but Rockstar is doing Rockstar things), God of War, Detroid (which is a pretty special case game, because David De Gruttola aka David Cage) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Have I forgotten anything? Wasn't there a new Yakuza game for PS4?

But on the PC side we got:
- Battlefield V (release was bad, but it's still a pretty good game, that also looks insanely good on PC if you have the hardware)
- Hitman 2 (feels a bit overlooked this year)
- CoD: BO4
- FarCry 5
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Monster Hunter: World
- Sea of Thieves
- Forza Horizon 4
- Sports games like Fifa
- Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Dragon Ball FighterZ (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Soulcalibur VI (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Hunt Showdown (maybe, it's still early access)

There are also some games with not the best reception like State of Decay 2, The Fallout game that shall not be named, etc.

In addition we have our constantly updated games, that are very big on PC too: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, DotA2, Warframe, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. (even Warcraft 3 got some love)

And if that's not enough, the indies (and friends) this year were sick too. Return of the Obra Dinn, Celeste, The Messenger, Dead Cells, Frostpunk, Into the Breach, Ashen, Below, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Banner Saga 3, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, Subnautica, Beat Saber, GRIS, X4: Foundations, Mega Man 11 (not an indie), Wizard of Legend, etc

For me it was an amazing year as a PC gamer. Ofc if you only look at PC exclusive AAA games for PC, then almost every year is a bad year for PC, because PC is an open platform and no deals prevent developers/publishers from releasing their games on other platforms too, so ofc if it's on pc and playable on other systems, then there will be a port at some point.

If you like that sort of game and haven't played GalCiv2, you're missing out.

GalCiv3 wasn't quite as strong, especially on release, but with each expansion it's been getting closer to the standards set by 2 and I've heard good things about the latest expansion, though I haven't tried it yet myself.

Meanwhile Sins of a Solar Empire is a cool semi-4x/rts kinda hybrid somewhat similar to Paradox strategy games in that instead of turns it's real-time but with adjustable speed and pausing. It's a unique rts that takes place on a massive battlefield that encompasses potentially dozens of solar systems yet surprisingly isn't overwhelming at all once you get used to the UI. It's more about combat than diplomacy or trade, so keep that in mind, but the battles it does exceptionally well with a focus on macro over micromanagement. Great mod community too!

Most of my gaming on PC now consists of indie titles that aren't afraid to try something new, or older games that still have a healthy modding scene.

I play the odd big-name title but they're becoming so formulaic and unimaginative. 

All Ubisoft games are basically the same shit and have been since Assassin's Creed 2. Theme-park environments artificially crafted around collectibles and junk loot.

EA just keeps pulling scummy monetisation moves and as a long-time Battlefield fan, the last two got old pretty fucking fast. I barely clocked up 30 hours before I decided I was done. I preferred the older ones.

Diablo 3 was a huge disappointment for me. I can't stand MMO's. MOBAs or Fortnite etc. Then again, I haven't liked a single Blizzard game apart from Diablo 1 and 2, and they weren't developed by Blizzard themselves.

The only ones I can think of in recent memory is RDR2 and FF XV
 
&gt;most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles

Wut? There's still a ton of exclusives, but not really any more than before- most of the exclusives this gen were also exclusives last gen, like Zelda or God of War. There's only been a few additions like Spider-Man and RDR2 (the latter of which is surely coming to PC, albeit at a later date).

&gt;PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles

You're forgetting Call of Duty, Battlefield, Fortnite, League, Dota, Pubg, Assassin's Creed, Fallout 76, Far Cry 5, Just Cause 4, Kingdom Come, Civ VI, Tomb Raider, Dragon Quest XI, Hitman 2, the majority of VR, Celeste, WoW: BfA, Dragon Ball FighterZ, FF XII:TZA, Artifact, Ni No Kuni II, Darksiders 3, SoulCalibur VI, Forza Horizon 4, Pillars of Eternity 2, Warhammer:Vermintide 2, Insurgency Sandstorm, shall I go on?

Ultimate.

Have I forgotten anything? Wasn't there a new Yakuza game for PS4?

But on the PC side we got:
- Battlefield V (release was bad, but it's still a pretty good game, that also looks insanely good on PC if you have the hardware)
- Hitman 2 (feels a bit overlooked this year)
- CoD: BO4
- FarCry 5
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Monster Hunter: World
- Sea of Thieves
- Forza Horizon 4
- Sports games like Fifa
- Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Dragon Ball FighterZ (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Soulcalibur VI (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Hunt Showdown (maybe, it's still early access)

There are also some games with not the best reception like State of Decay 2, The Fallout game that shall not be named, etc.

In addition we have our constantly updated games, that are very big on PC too: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, DotA2, Warframe, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. (even Warcraft 3 got some love)

And if that's not enough, the indies (and friends) this year were sick too.

For me it was an amazing year as a PC gamer. Ofc if you only look at PC exclusive AAA games for PC, then almost every year is a bad year for PC, because PC is an open platform and no deals prevent developers/publishers from releasing their games on other platforms too, so ofc if it's on pc and playable on other systems, then there will be a port at some point.

On one hand the publisher has the final say but the developer is not that easily ignored, especially when they are in generally good terms like between EA and Bioware.

And then there's a very heavy developer involvement to Anthem's marketing. What we see with the likes of Battlefield V with scheduled press previews and community managers, that's publisher-led. But everything with Anthem up until now was led by 3 people - Mike Gamble (Edmonton lead producer), Ben Irving (Austin lead producer), Mark Darrah (Overlord producer), with occasional chime in from Jon Warner (Overlord everything about the game). They have been answering question on Twitter every day and hosting the streams since around August, and other than the apparent guideline it has been as non-corporate as possible, much more so than pre-ME3 days. Some of these are likely Bio's own envisioning, or maybe just the desire to communicate with fans more than what was originally mandated by EA.

Either way I hope the project leads are rewarded by heaps and bounds for what they did with Anthem's marketing. They were already busy making the game and they made time to do all this by themselves.",1546316265,1,1546312665.0,Battlefield,0.97173035

GalCiv3 wasn't quite as strong, especially on release, but with each expansion it's been getting closer to the standards set by 2 and I've heard good things about the latest expansion, though I haven't tried it yet myself.

Meanwhile Sins of a Solar Empire is a cool semi-4x/rts kinda hybrid somewhat similar to Paradox strategy games in that instead of turns it's real-time but with adjustable speed and pausing. It's a unique rts that takes place on a massive battlefield that encompasses potentially dozens of solar systems yet surprisingly isn't overwhelming at all once you get used to the UI. It's more about combat than diplomacy or trade, so keep that in mind, but the battles it does exceptionally well with a focus on macro over micromanagement. Great mod community too!

GalCiv3 wasn't quite as strong, especially on release, but with each expansion it's been getting closer to the standards set by 2 and I've heard good things about the latest expansion, though I haven't tried it yet myself.

Meanwhile Sins of a Solar Empire is a cool semi-4x/rts kinda hybrid somewhat similar to Paradox strategy games in that instead of turns it's real-time but with adjustable speed and pausing. It's a unique rts that takes place on a massive battlefield that encompasses potentially dozens of solar systems yet surprisingly isn't overwhelming at all once you get used to the UI. It's more about combat than diplomacy or trade, so keep that in mind, but the battles it does exceptionally well with a focus on macro over micromanagement. Great mod community too!

Haven't played the others, though I do somehow own Ashes so I really should give it a try sometime. Overall though even for just GalCiv2 and Sins at the lowest tier, if you don't own them and like strategy games it's a great deal!",1546374220,1,1546370620.0,Battlefield,0.9998622

The only ones I can think of in recent memory is RDR2 and FF XV
 
&gt;most of the blockbusters outside of Rockstar are becoming single platform titles

Wut? There's still a ton of exclusives, but not really any more than before- most of the exclusives this gen were also exclusives last gen, like Zelda or God of War. There's only been a few additions like Spider-Man and RDR2 (the latter of which is surely coming to PC, albeit at a later date).

&gt;PC while a major platform isn't getting massive titles

1491,392,ThePhilosophersGames,"I think it depends on how much you liked the console exclusives. The only AAA games we didn't get this year were RDR2 (which could come to PC in theory, but Rockstar is doing Rockstar things), God of War, Detroid (which is a pretty special case game, because David De Gruttola aka David Cage) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Have I forgotten anything? Wasn't there a new Yakuza game for PS4?

But on the PC side we got:
- Battlefield V (release was bad, but it's still a pretty good game, that also looks insanely good on PC if you have the hardware)
- Hitman 2 (feels a bit overlooked this year)
- CoD: BO4
- FarCry 5
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Monster Hunter: World
- Sea of Thieves
- Forza Horizon 4
- Sports games like Fifa
- Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Dragon Ball FighterZ (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Soulcalibur VI (could be counted as AAA at least for Fighting Game standards)
- Hunt Showdown (maybe, it's still early access)

There are also some games with not the best reception like State of Decay 2, The Fallout game that shall not be named, etc.

In addition we have our constantly updated games, that are very big on PC too: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, DotA2, Warframe, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. (even Warcraft 3 got some love)

And if that's not enough, the indies (and friends) this year were sick too. Return of the Obra Dinn, Celeste, The Messenger, Dead Cells, Frostpunk, Into the Breach, Ashen, Below, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Banner Saga 3, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, Subnautica, Beat Saber, GRIS, X4: Foundations, Mega Man 11 (not an indie), Wizard of Legend, etc

For me it was an amazing year as a PC gamer. Ofc if you only look at PC exclusive AAA games for PC, then almost every year is a bad year for PC, because PC is an open platform and no deals prevent developers/publishers from releasing their games on other platforms too, so ofc if it's on pc and playable on other systems, then there will be a port at some point.

1527,2,Dohi64,"**[word wonders: the tower of babel:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362790/)** I love word games, though I don't think anything can ever surpass **[letter quest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/373970/)** (no, **bookworm adventures** isn't better, it's really frustrating sometimes and doesn't have a dictionary). certainly not this, I thought, it didn't look too promising, but better than some others and beggars can't be choosers. there are only 3 other word games left unplayed in my library, I saved those for later.

no volume sliders, only music on/off, sound on/off and windowed mode, but full screen just adds a background and doesn't actually increase the game area, everything's dumped in the middle of the screen, which is fine most of the time. the writing's cheesy, as you'd expect, don't have a problem with that, but you can only pause the game during your turn.

it's more difficult than expected, because it plays kinda like **scrabble**, from what I know, never played it myself, so words have to connect to letters already on the board, then the new word will be the base for the next turn. no timer though, and if you fuck up, the game tells you there's something wrong (word not connected, not a word, etc.) and you can always shuffle letters for free, though it ends your turn, while spells don't, you can use those as long as you have energy and they're not on a cooldown.

there are 50 stages with various layouts and board sizes, each can be played on 3 difficulties with a star for each. after every few stars (more towards the end) you gain a level, more hp and energy, often a new crafting recipe, and at level 7 and 15 you unlock the other two difficulties. money can be spent on ingredients and potions (not necessary, plenty of drops from levels), plus letters and letter upgrades for the boost board and board upgrades as well.

the boost board is where it's at, you can put letters you get or buy on it to get more hp, energy and unlock more spells. 'respeccing' is as easy as moving letters around, as long as words are connected, so once again, very scrabbly. this is where the small resolution is a bit of a problem, but it's not too bad, and of course as you get more letters and space, it can be a good idea to re-do it from scratch for a better result, which can be a pain, though with only 2 upgrades (they cost 500, 1000, 2500 and 5000) and every letter upgraded to gold (letter packs and upgrades cost the same throughout the game) I managed to rack up 850 points without restarting, then with the not-necessary-at-all 3rd board and some more letters I ended up with 1250 points, so 100+ hp and nearly 100 energy, more than enough to kill everything, though some boss fights were still tough, since I didn't use any consumables. I could've improved the board some more towards the end, but I didn't bother.

I used a single small bomb during the first final boss fight, I was very close to winning or losing on the first try and had tons of stuff, figured I might as well use at least one item during the entire game. then a big healing potion on the second difficulty to finish faster, but the third version still took a few tries and his fuckery got really old by then, so I wanted to spam items to be done with it, but that's when I learned only 1 item can be used per turn. makes sense, it just never came up before. and I'm pretty sure bosses cheat, constantly making 5-8-letter words is not rng, it's fucked up, but they can be [really satisfying](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1613178022) sometimes.

so the game's actually more complex than I thought, and while it didn't de-throne **letter quest**, it came as close second, I really enjoyed my time with it, save for a few frustrating boss fights and their superior vocabulary compared to mine. but hey, as always, I learned some new stuff the fun way. combat is slow, as in you can (and have to) see as your dmg/magic goes up one by one based on the word you made, then as it accumulates on the other side, then takes away enemy hp one by one, then the same for the opponent's turn, etc.

it might look like a cheap mobile game and seem grindy at first, but winning every level just once had me drowning in money and loot, so no worries there, just make sure to go back to earlier floors and do all 3 difficulties once to gain some levels. even the final board upgrade wouldn't be that hard to get if you don't buy too many letters, but I figured I'd work with what I got. the music's surprisingly good as well. all in all, highly recommended, it's cheap as dicks and provides many hours of edutainment.

**[didgery:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/429270/)** a solitaire/matching thing. normally I wouldn't buy an endless/pointless game, even my puzzlers need to have hand-made levels, if not some sort of story, but I figured for 49 cents I can fool around with it for a few hours and it'll have served its purpose, much like the first **bejeweled**, which I only got for completeness' sake and because it has the best music of the series (skaven/future crew is pretty amazing). and this one is at least a bit different from the usual solitaire offerings I otherwise enjoy.

there are volume sliders and calming music borrowed from free sources, and achievements to go for if you're that sort of person, and fragments of a story of some description, but you need 6+ chains to break those cards free when they come up, and I'm not really good at this because chains have to be of the same suit and only in desceding order, aces are low, and you can only switch suits if their value is the same. an even easier mode could've been introduced where only numbers matter, not suits, or you could go up and down, and it still wouldn't necessarily be that easy, but more fun.

it also crashed to desktop after about 20 minutes, just when I was about to break free the first story thing. then it turned out it's just one of the special cards. what I also thought to be a story thing turned out to be the nightmare mode unlock and it was annoying as fuck because it turned the screen black &amp; white and covered half of it with fucking dialog every few seconds. genius... nightmare mode is the same but with a timer, so no thanks. I think I'll play until I unlock all the special cards and fragments, it's fine for short periods before bed or whenever. [there's a demo as well](https://www.indiedb.com/games/didgery/downloads/didgery), as I found out after buying it.

**[the darkside detective:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368390/)** it's a really funny, pixely point &amp; click adventure with 9 short cases to solve and great music by ben prunty (**ftl** among other things). loved the **demo**, loved the full game, didn't mind that it's short either, and the sequel/season 2 is in the works already. it's not terribly difficult, but I overlooked a few things even with such gigantic pixels, and sliding pipe puzzles and similar minigames can fuck off even on a good day.

if they'd just let you take every item you'll need anytime, it'd involve less going back to places and taking stuff you couldn't before. on the one hand it makes things even easier because you never have more than a couple items on you, on the other it makes things more difficult because fuck backtracking and remembering every object that may or may not be pickupable eventually. and the worst is when there's nothing in a container until a plot point, and by then you'd already examined it and why would you do it again? shitty game design.

**fun fact:** I'm now at over 1000 screenshots on steam. I thought **terraria** would be number one with 132 since release, then **two worlds** coming in second with 111, but apparently I took 164 shots from **risen 3**. another 91 from **risen 2** and a measly 58 from **risen**, so more than half comes from only 5 games, the rest from about 100 others from the 300+ I've already completed from a library of nearly 550. would've happened sooner, but some of my games are in other clients.

I disagree with your premise, I think it is only right if you think the quality of movies would go up and not down if the movies that are nominated for best pictures were not made. 

Movies still have incredible diversity, just go see things that win at Cannes to see if Oscars have defined for the world what ""good"" movies are, independent films are still thriving. If anything mid budget films are dying, and the only ones that still exist are being made for said Oscars.

When you reward studios, producers, people who can finance games for making quality instead of popularity, you make more people finance things with the aim of quality instead of popularity.

To me your argument would be the same for being against any game reviews. Game reviews establish what the ""right"" kind of game is, establish the consensus on games. And yet they are the reason why studios can not get away with broken games, why they aim for quality (metacritic bonuses), and why if they nickle and dime too much they get trashed (battlefront 2, fallout 76).",1546535919,1,1546532319.0,Battlefront,0.8814741

That's why preorders are still a thing. There is absolutely no reason to preorder games these days, yet people still do it so they get it release date (or even before) and can play ASAP. If a review comes out months later, nobody is going to give a shit. Reviewers want hits, and they aren't going to get near as many if they wait a few months. 

Everybody is to blame for this. Publishers want ALL the money, as stated elsewhere. Reviewers want hits, AKA money. Gamers want to play new games ASAP and continue to buy publishers games despite their history of scummy practices. Publishers are businessmen. Not gamers. If they make money, they don't give a fuck about the small voice those of us on reddit. When we do yell loud enough and eat into their profits (a la Battlefront 2), they will change it and implement some other scummy practice (well see how Anthem fucks us...).

What's really sad is, if you really think about it, they are targeting kids with this bullshit. Most adults probably don't give a shit about what skin their character or gun has.

* League of Legends  --  Meaningful content, individually purchasable (very frustrating, will not play)

 Kingdom Come: While for some people buggy for me it was not buggy at all (I played the day after launch) and it was by FAR my favorite single player experience this game. Sometimes I wish I could forget everything about this game and play it completly from the beginning again. 


Odyssey was also really good. The best AC since Black Flag.


Hitman 2 was just perfect. I love all new Hitman games. They are really great.

Ok Fallout 76 was a disaster but lets be honest with our self. It was forseeable from 3 miles away. 

Then we also had the first Madden for PC for years (I normaly dont count sport games as blockbusters but in this case its ok). 


Then Yakuza seemed to be really good from what I heared. Forza also. 


Football Manager 2019 is the best FM since at least 2012 so its fine too. 


Far Cry 5 is my favorite Far Cry so far. 




Obviously PC gaming had better years but there are still some gems this year and I have seen way way worse (just remember 2017...)


2017: Had car crashes like For Honor, Need for Speed, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3, CoD WWII, SW Battlefront II, ^Spellforce 3 (decent at best)



And some decent - good games: Like Sniper Elite 4, Divinity: Original Sin II, Wildlands, Tekken 7, Project Cars, TW: Warhammer II (though I really dont like the Warhammer universe), Origins, Wolfenstein II, Destiny 2,

1547,19,itaveL,"Activision doesn't care. He's done his job marketing BO4 for them already. 

This is the problem, as gaming ""journalists"" and ""gaming reviewers"" seemingly have no backbone against these types of predatory tactics. After all, their channel, livelihood, site, or patreon etc. lives and dies by their reviews and video content. You could argue him deleting his review shows that he cares, but we'll see how long that integrity lasts when COD is released next year. 

Even if every reviewer mass deleted their game, the metacritic score isn't going to change. 

I will say this act of turning on the microtransactions weeks after the review cycle's complete is up there as some of the absolute scumbaggiest tactics devised by the industry's bigwigs. This is also relatively new, as I can't recall it happening before this year (but I could be wrong). Usually it's the other way around with the microtransactions being turned off due to some form of outrage, and then re-enabled or altered once the storm dies down (Battlefront 2). 

2018 has shown that Publishers are always evolving in how they monetize their products, which was a given, and Rockstar and Activision have both started a scary trend for the future of game reviewers. Content creators, reviewers, and any other game influencers will need to either grow a backbone and stop promoting companies that manipulate the market, in this way, or the community is going to have to start giving a fuck to stop it. Both of these seem unlikely, in my cynical opinion, and this is why monetization tactics are only getting worse.

As Jim Sterling puts it, ""publishers don't just want some of the moeny, they want ALL of the money"". Even then, having record breaking sales numbers and yearly revenue isn't enough.

Otherwise, people would simply not purchase any of these things because they're rip-offs and they'd go away. As long as the market supports predatory microtransactions, they'll exist, so why shouldn't they cash in?

  


You're wrong here.

  


I see the concept of ""whales"" be misused all the time by gamers. What gamers mean by whales is a person that buys a ton of microtransactions. That's wrong. Thing is there are no whales on PC/console gaming, because p2w games aren't working out with traditional gamers (yet). The term ""whale"" exists to describe players that spend thousands, even millions of money in mobile games to get p2w upgrades and dominate f2p players or players that spend much less. They don't mind continuously pouring the cash to keep staying ahead either. It's symbolic, just like whales swim through waters with their mouths open to devour tiny creatures, that's how these players that spend fuck tons of money breeze through these f2p games to dominate on people that are playing for free or those that are paying less than them. And they love the feeling.

  


That's what a whale is. I suggest you play some popular p2w games mobile games to get an idea. Try out Lords Mobile for a start, when you hit the paywall and realize how essential paying is, you'll realize how much money the top or even average players there have spent to be able to enjoy the game.

  


Somebody spending thousands on Fortnite or League skins is not a whale, that's a collector. Collectors are relatively harmless, after all all they want is to own all the cosmetic options games have to offer.

  


Also, you'd be surprised but it's not the whales that drive most of microtransaction revenue. Sure they spend a ton, but the collectors I mentioned above combined with casual spenders of Fortnite, League and other such games add up and that's how microtransactions are super successful.

  


Which leads me to your point about microtransactions alienating the majority of their playerbase. That's flat out wrong. Do you mean Reddit by ""majority""? Because even Reddit is torn on that matter. The majority of people do no mind microtransactions at all actually, in fact they are responsible for how successful microtransactions are nowadays. Even though they might be casual about their spending, it adds up and since there are millions of them it amounts to insane numbers. Just check Fortnite, Overwatch, League etc.

  


Whales in traditional gaming (PC, consoles) don't exist yet with a couple exceptions like Hearthstone and games like it and GTA: O/RDR: O, since they are p2w. Other than that there are no p2w games that I know of, EA did try to lure in the whales with Battlefront 2 p2w fiasco though.

Movies still have incredible diversity, just go see things that win at Cannes to see if Oscars have defined for the world what ""good"" movies are, independent films are still thriving. If anything mid budget films are dying, and the only ones that still exist are being made for said Oscars.

When you reward studios, producers, people who can finance games for making quality instead of popularity, you make more people finance things with the aim of quality instead of popularity.

To me your argument would be the same for being against any game reviews. Game reviews establish what the ""right"" kind of game is, establish the consensus on games.

This is also relatively new, as I can't recall it happening before this year (but I could be wrong). Usually it's the other way around with the microtransactions being turned off due to some form of outrage, and then re-enabled or altered once the storm dies down (Battlefront 2). 

2018 has shown that Publishers are always evolving in how they monetize their products, which was a given, and Rockstar and Activision have both started a scary trend for the future of game reviewers. Content creators, reviewers, and any other game influencers will need to either grow a backbone and stop promoting companies that manipulate the market, in this way, or the community is going to have to start giving a fuck to stop it. Both of these seem unlikely, in my cynical opinion, and this is why monetization tactics are only getting worse.

As Jim Sterling puts it, ""publishers don't just want some of the moeny, they want ALL of the money"". Even then, having record breaking sales numbers and yearly revenue isn't enough.

Otherwise, people would simply not purchase any of these things because they're rip-offs and they'd go away. As long as the market supports predatory microtransactions, they'll exist, so why shouldn't they cash in?

  


You're wrong here.

  


I see the concept of ""whales"" be misused all the time by gamers. What gamers mean by whales is a person that buys a ton of microtransactions. That's wrong. Thing is there are no whales on PC/console gaming, because p2w games aren't working out with traditional gamers (yet). The term ""whale"" exists to describe players that spend thousands, even millions of money in mobile games to get p2w upgrades and dominate f2p players or players that spend much less. They don't mind continuously pouring the cash to keep staying ahead either. It's symbolic, just like whales swim through waters with their mouths open to devour tiny creatures, that's how these players that spend fuck tons of money breeze through these f2p games to dominate on people that are playing for free or those that are paying less than them. And they love the feeling.

  


That's what a whale is. I suggest you play some popular p2w games mobile games to get an idea. Try out Lords Mobile for a start, when you hit the paywall and realize how essential paying is, you'll realize how much money the top or even average players there have spent to be able to enjoy the game.

  


Somebody spending thousands on Fortnite or League skins is not a whale, that's a collector. Collectors are relatively harmless, after all all they want is to own all the cosmetic options games have to offer.

  


Also, you'd be surprised but it's not the whales that drive most of microtransaction revenue. Sure they spend a ton, but the collectors I mentioned above combined with casual spenders of Fortnite, League and other such games add up and that's how microtransactions are super successful.

  


Which leads me to your point about microtransactions alienating the majority of their playerbase. That's flat out wrong. Do you mean Reddit by ""majority""? Because even Reddit is torn on that matter. The majority of people do no mind microtransactions at all actually, in fact they are responsible for how successful microtransactions are nowadays. Even though they might be casual about their spending, it adds up and since there are millions of them it amounts to insane numbers. Just check Fortnite, Overwatch, League etc.

  


Whales in traditional gaming (PC, consoles) don't exist yet with a couple exceptions like Hearthstone and games like it and GTA: O/RDR: O, since they are p2w. Other than that there are no p2w games that I know of, EA did try to lure in the whales with Battlefront 2 p2w fiasco though. As a rule of thumb, whales go where p2w is.",1546707477,1,1546703877.0,Battlefront,0.99634486

There is nothing wrong with cosmetic only microtransactions and the live service can work if implemented properly. Yeah, EA has a horrible track record and we don't have to trust them. I do trust Bioware though and they haven't really proven to be inept at making a good game.  


So far from what we have seen, the game has incredible potential. Graphics are on point, they have a good story/setting that has a ton of potential, class design and loot philosophy are on point and we have been told time and time again from the developers themselves, that there will be no paid story content, no lootboxes and no pay2win.

I disagree with your premise, I think it is only right if you think the quality of movies would go up and not down if the movies that are nominated for best pictures were not made. 

Movies still have incredible diversity, just go see things that win at Cannes to see if Oscars have defined for the world what ""good"" movies are, independent films are still thriving. If anything mid budget films are dying, and the only ones that still exist are being made for said Oscars.

When you reward studios, producers, people who can finance games for making quality instead of popularity, you make more people finance things with the aim of quality instead of popularity.

To me your argument would be the same for being against any game reviews. Game reviews establish what the ""right"" kind of game is, establish the consensus on games. And yet they are the reason why studios can not get away with broken games, why they aim for quality (metacritic bonuses), and why if they nickle and dime too much they get trashed (battlefront 2, fallout 76).",1546535919,1,1546532319.0,Battlefront,0.8814741

If a review comes out months later, nobody is going to give a shit. Reviewers want hits, and they aren't going to get near as many if they wait a few months. 

Everybody is to blame for this. Publishers want ALL the money, as stated elsewhere. Reviewers want hits, AKA money. Gamers want to play new games ASAP and continue to buy publishers games despite their history of scummy practices. Publishers are businessmen. Not gamers. If they make money, they don't give a fuck about the small voice those of us on reddit.

Hitman 2 was just perfect. I love all new Hitman games. They are really great.

Ok Fallout 76 was a disaster but lets be honest with our self. It was forseeable from 3 miles away.

Then Yakuza seemed to be really good from what I heared. Forza also. 


Football Manager 2019 is the best FM since at least 2012 so its fine too.

EA is a much more recognized name among casual gamers. If I asked someone what games does EA make they will likely say Madden and Fifa. Honestly I couldn't tell you who the actual devs teams are for those games. I just know they are EA products. 

Somewhat the same with Activision. People associate that name with COD. 

Zenimax, even in gaming media, is much less talked about compared to those studios. I have never once heard someone who isn't a hardcore gamer mention that name. Yet I have heard them mention EA/Activision/Ubisoft. Zenimax just isn't in the spotlight that much. When FO76 flopped did anyone, even on here, talk about Zenimax and their relation to all of this?

Most people seemed to be in agreement that the initial state of Battlefront II was completely unacceptable and one of the worst money-grabs ever. And yet, you could technically unlock everything in that game for free as well; it would just take a really fucking long time.

I hate sweeping statements that people try to pass off as defenses. ""You can unlock it all for free"" while ignoring how long it takes to unlock things for free. ""It's only cosmetic"" while ignoring which factors of a game should just be included without having to pay. etc.

Like you said, we are really seeing how well these companies have warped people's minds. It's insane how far people bend over backward to defend the people who are fucking them over. Like you said, 10 years ago, just about everything happening in the AAA gaming market would have been completely unacceptable.

&gt;What I said was that what drew me to the franchise with DAO was that it felt to me like MMO combat

It's lovely that WoW drew you into Dragon Age. But that doesn't mean they are anything alike.

&gt;I think many people would disagree that WOW is never about strategy.

What are you talking about. Do you have a different definition of strategy too?

&gt;How doesn't it fit? I very much enjoy 

WoW is balanced around the game being real time and players having to keep track of multiple abilities in a very finite time whilst also having to be aware of boss abilities or enemy players in PvP.

&gt;youve shat on the combat a lot but you haven't actually gone in to detail of what makes it bad to you.

I have in considerable detail. Watch the video again, see how those things measure up in DA:I. Or don't, I'm not really here to change your mind.

&gt;I also don't think that the complexity of the combat is really that different from DAO to DAI

There's a huge difference. It's not misremembering at all.

&gt;you can do whatever you want

At the default difficult level in DA:O, many of the fights, and yes of course many of the boss fights were enjoyably challenging. Nothing in DA:I was challenging. You can play the game on default difficulty and just watch the AI play the game itself. Interaction is almost optional. At higher difficulties not a whole lot changes, most of the problems in the combat persist.

1690,12,moomoolinoo15,"So during Christmas I was playing a myriad of games and here are my thoughts on them.  


**Persona 5**

My main Christmas game this year. I thought that I would finish Yakuza Kiwami and AC Origins but I managed to finish this game instead (after 2 years). I was quite surprised by the ending, I thought that there are still 20+ hours remaining. The truth is that my ending was ""the bad"" one so I will probably replay the ending once more to get to ""the true"" one. On the other hand, this can not influence my opinion on the game - the best game I have ever played. Like EVER. Really! I started with games at the beginning of this century, I went through 100+ games (from start to finish) and tried hundreds more games. I played literally all AAA games available in the EU/US. I thought that nonthing can surprise me anymore. But Persona 5 took my breath. It was a crazy ride from the very beginning to the very end. It was fantastic, spectacular. Peaople are often discussing whether games are an art. And I believe that this one specific game is hell of a piece of art. Its like Picasso´s painting or Beethoven´s music. I absolutely love the game and I doubt that I will play anything as good anytime soon.

**Uncharted 4**

My second main Christmas game this year. Spent approx 10 hours in it. Although I was enjoying the gameplay, I like the fact that there will probably be no more Uncharted in following decade. It is the same game for 4th time just with slightly better graphics. I have the ending spoiled (due to Lost Legacy) so the story does not motivate me to play it. The game in general is pretty good, just reminds me of the previous episodes too much. Still NaughtyDog proves again that is probably the best game developper of this era.

**Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony**

Well I found out about this game thanks to you, guys. I have never heard ot read about it before. I decided to give it a shot and..well I still can not decide whether I like it or not. The setting is interesting and the main idea is awesome (kind of twisted battle royale). On the other hand the controls are disgusting and graphics in non-comics parts too. Generally the trials are interesting but everything else is just wrong - too long, too bad and too uninteresting. Also the murders are overcomplicated and I do not like the idea that one is unable to find the murderer just by using common sense. The game is coming with crazy ideas and unrealistic situations. Still I am pretty motivated to keep playing it due to monokuma and monokubs. Also, the background story about students losing their memories is quite catchy. I will probably see in a close future if it is worth continuing.

**Pathfinder Kingmaker**

I love Dragon Age Origins which is one of my TOP5 games ever. Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity are good games but IMO are not the real successors of DAO. So far, Pathfinder seems to be closest to the ""ideal"" gameplay of DAO. The combat system is pretty similar, the graphics is really good and the story seems promising. I will definitely give it another shot when I have more time for it. I have just one problem with the game - the amount of party members (6) is too large to be able to manage your team properly in tactical mode. Also, I do not understand the abilities. From the very beginning, each party member has approx. 8 abilities available and none of them is precisely described. Thus I have no idea what is the impact of each ability.

**Ashen**

Ashen is a game that shot me like a bolt from the blue. I did know nothing about the game untill it appeared in GamePass. I thought that the graphics is pretty interesting so I tried it. So far I am approx 2 hours into it and I must say that it is absolutely awesome. It was a long time ago I played an rpg with so ""pure"" gameplay. It is just a fun, nothing bothers me there, nothing interrupts the gameplay. This makes Ashen another really good game that I want to spend my time with. And yes - the mix of Dark Souls and more traditional rpgs like Risen or TES is enchanting.

**Thronebreaker**

Well after strong first half of december when I spent more than 10 hours with this game, I was able to find only approx. 1 hour for it during Christmas. I still believe that Thronebreaker is one of the best games of 2018 and maybe the founder of a new genre, however it is slowly losing its pace while I am getting past the first half. It becomes very repetitive and pretty easy in most standard battles. On the other hand the puzzle battles are just too difficult for my stupid brain and I am not enjoying them at all. I think I just need a break and I will love the game again.

&amp;#x200B;

So at the end I did not find myself playing AC Origins and Yakuza Kiwami at all, even though finishing those 2 games was my goal n.1 for this Christmas. On the other hand I spent many hours playing other great games and I do not regret it.",1546958820,1,1546955220.0,Dragon Age,0.77987915

The whole phenomenon of AAA games like Dragon Age Inquisition getting great reviews, but later being seen as subpar definitely speaks to recency bias. Also, I feel like we've yet to develop a good vocabulary to write about games with, which is why journos tend to default to talking about story and aesthetic - people know how to write about those, whereas the terms we use for gameplay (crunchy, tight, visceral) have been abused to the point they mean almost nothing. Although I think this is less of an issue for more rules-based games. I've seen some very good articles talking about mechanics in Slay the Spire, for example.

That's largely why I tend to find the only good writing in games journalism tends to come in thinkpieces about aesthetics, story, politics, etc. The base for discussing those is wellfounded, and liberal arts educations prime you to write about that sort of thing almost regardless of what degree you have.

Making a mainstream single box genre game with a fixed known budget is easy, and has no long tail costs.

I can't stand 30fps, it's distracting and makes fast-paced games genuinely harder to play and just less fun overall. I've still powered through a lot of games in spite of this (mostly console exclusives) but I've also dropped a few because of it. It varies.

As others have said, consistency is really important too. I've been playing Dragon Age Inquisition lately and it drives me crazy because all the cutscenes are capped at 30fps when the rest of the game isn't. The constant switching is far more annoying than if the game was just capped at 30 at all times.

1728,50,dab1,"Yes. For me it started with Dragon Age: Origins. I pre-ordered and bought the Deluxe Edition at full price.  
Then [this was in the game](http://abload.de/img/daorigins-2010-07-30-42fza.jpg), a npc at your camp talks about some quest and when I think that sounds like a interesting mission he finish and the sentece to accept says ""(Download new content) Give me a moment and I'll help you. Also you had to buy the Bioware Points first and then the DLC and I don't remember but it probably was one of those were you need to pay 10€ for 800 or 20€ for 1600 but the DLCs are less than 800BP or more than 800 but less than 1600.  
Year and a half later I bought the Ultimate Edition on Steam por 15€.  
Since DA:O the only two ""AAA"" games that I pre-ordered and bought on release day were The Witcher 2 in 2011 and Tomb Raider in 2013.  
Between the *wait for GOTY Edition*, *wait for patches/bug fixes* and that I have a huge backlog of games that I want to play I don't feel the ""need"" to play a game on release day (the downside is potential spoilers in heavy story based games).  
  
In addition games like FFXV when it released on PC had DLC included BUT 4 new DLCs were planned for 2019 (now 3 of them cancelled), Shadow of The Tomb Raider had DLCs planned until March 2019 4 months before release, BFV had that battle royale mode, Firestorm, as part of the promotional material before the game launched, that mode is not available yet and I think that the date is still TBA.  

The other trend that they are pushing is time limited content and requiring to be always-online in single player games. Ubisoft has events like ""Trials of the Gods"" in Assassin's Creed Origins and IOI the elusive targets in Hitman. All that content isn't available for people like me that wait for the ""complete"" edition.",1546471171,1,1546467571.0,Dragon Age,0.03265392
1729,51,Fynriel,"&gt; What game does? All AAA games are derivative

I don't think that's true at all. What stands out to me as derivative is open world content formulas, quest design and the like. But the worlds we inhabit are completely different. AAA games that are indeed very cookie cutter stand out from the crowd. You see that same third person stealth mechanic where you hide in ""hiding spots"" and casually clear out an enemy camp in a lot of games. That's derivative, yes. It diminishes many games' unique settings with generic content and a copy/paste approach to level and quest design. *That* I will grant you. But the worlds themselves are unique. And looking specifically at the big MMO shooters, Destiny and the Division, I strongly feel that both have a unique identity. Visually, concerning setting, narratively, and mechanically. Just not in terms of content design perhaps. Anthem doesn't feel unique in the former categories, either, however.

It also feels like a mockery of modern game tropes. And that may not necessarily be its own fault. It may be timing thing. For example: We've had so many of these generic player character descriptors - like 'Guardian' in Destiny. And BioWare in particular LOVES those: in Mass Effect we were a 'Spectre', in Dragon Age a 'Warden', in Andromeda they chose 'Pathfinder'. Somehow all these games until now have gotten away with it if their title at least sounded somewhat unique. But excuse me, ""Freelancer""? Seriously. It sounds soooo uninventive. And at this point in time it elicists a huge eye roll reaction from the audience. Like ""Oh, it's what you call your Guardians, how creative...."" It has almost become comical at this point I feel. It's kind of a gaming trope now. And Anthem just comes across with its own version of that, completely unironically. It's more than a bit cringey.

And honestly, to me it's the core ingredients that differentiate it from Destiny and The Division. You can lob all the critique in the world at Destiny's launch and The Division's launch, both were disastrous, and you can also criticize the mess that it Destiny's store like I said. But the core ingredients they originally created...I mean Joseph Staten is an incredible worldbuilder. Before all the stuff that happened behind the scenes where they rebooted the whole story 6 months before release, the writing staff created something that was, in my opinion, as deep and engaging as Halo. This is especially noticable with names. Bungie has always been spectacular when it comes to naming things: Characters, ships, places. They all somehow become instantly iconic. Now Anthem...like I already alluded to with the Freelancer thing, BioWare seems to have failed utterly and naming the elements of the world something memorable. And again, it may simply be a timing thing, but the entire premise of Anthem seems sooo been there done that. I didn't have that feeling with Destiny. The Hive lore seemed really intriguing. There's a sub called Destinylore. Now I'll bet you 1000 bucks there will never be an Anthemlore, because it will never capture people's imagination in the same way.

SWTOR was story focused WoW but not quite as good.

Mass Effect was cover/corridor shooter and arguably the best franchise out of the bunch, marred by a really controversial conclusion and middling game plays.

Dragon Age Inquisition was Bioware's take on open world game but only highlighted all the flaws of an open world game by making it a lifeless, empty experience. 

Anthem is Bioware's take on loot shooters, and it remain to be seen on how they take on that genre, chasing two iterations of Destiny and Division and even Warframe. I hope it will be good because I have a weak spot for mech suits.

David Gaider, formerly of Bioware, described the writing style for Dragon Age games many times on his blog, and part of that is that they did exactly that: editors had their own characters that they wrote for, and everything that character said went by them. Bioware obviously built their golden era on their characters, so it clearly worked out pretty well for them.

You had to farm reagents for your healing potions. It wasn't Witcher 3 level farming, it felt like vanilla WoW stupidity. There was no skill involved, no strategy, there was nothing you could get better at. The game mostly played itself and interactivity was almost optional. At higher difficulties the enemies just did more damage and you did less. The game didn't get smarter. The strategy view controls and UI was very badly done.

This is the problem I have with games like this, or Skyrim. They pretend to be action games, but they aren't. They fail as action games, but they also fail as turn based games.

#**Week of 1/1-1/5**

**Games finished**:

 Ufouria: The Saga

Yakuza Kiwami

**Games played**

Disgaea 5 (Post-game) 

Dragon Quest 11

**Games touched (under 1 hour)**

Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance


**Ufouria: The Saga **

Platform: NES/Famicom

There’s a lot of reasons to pick up a game. Maybe it has deep combat. Maybe it has a well-written story. Maybe it has a playable character who’s a ghost wearing sunglasses.

Developed by Sunsoft, Hebereke was a late release for the NES, coming out in Japan a year after the Super Famicom released. A year later, in 1992, Hebereke was translated as Ufouria for a European release. Besides the name change, Ufouria also features some sprite changes (like the cat character being turned into a dragon) and an awkward English translation.

As the name hints at, Ufouria features 4 playable character. The snowman-looking Bob-Louie (a penguin in Japan) is joined by the dragon Freeon-Leon, Shades the ghost, and Gil the fish on a journey to defeat the evil Unyo. There’s the same kind of weird-cute art style that appears in games like Bonk, which was the main reason I kept playing. Almost every area had something exciting to find, like the walking lips or the bird that flies around with a propeller hat. Instead of ropes, you climb up drool from floating faces.

Uforuia’s gameplay is a pretty simple metroidvania platformer. At any point you can switch between any of the unlocked characters to get around the world and jump on enemies. A strange quirk to Ufouria is the fact you have to hold the down button while landing on enemies if you want to damage them. There’s moments for each character, but most don’t control that well. Bob-Louie moves the fastest and later gets the ability to climb up walls, which makes playing as any of the other characters feel slow and awkward. 

While playing the game can be annoying and it very clearly shows its age at times, I found the overall 4 hours it took be enjoyable. There are later games (and some earlier games) that feel better to play, but the strange charm of Ufouria more than makes up for that. 

Also, there is a UFO in the game, which makes the title a triple pun.


**Yakuza Kiwami**

I finished Kiwami last night, so this write-up is going to be more unstructured and more just a collection of random thoughts.

If you haven’t played it,I found recommend playing Yakuza 0 first. 0 is a bigger game that sets up Kiwami well while also having better side-stories. 

I played through Yakuza 0 over the last year, which means I already played most of Kiwami when I started it. The two games share even more than the same setting, engine, and combat. Major plot points are mirrored in both games, from the hidden area with a fighting arena near the water to a visit to a different location that’s followed by a chase.

Combat in Yakuza tends to be fun, with a few very frustrating exceptions. When it’s time to fight my way through a building, taking on group after group of enemies, Kiwami is exciting and fun. When it’s time to face off a cheap boss that makes me mash X a bunch of times, I’m tempted to just quit playing. There’s also an early abilitease which doesn’t fully tell you what was taken away, which led to some confusion early on.

The main story was the main reason I kept playing Kiwami. It’s nice to see how characters have changed in the 20 years since 0, and the new characters are all interesting. 

Part of the charm of Yakuza 0 was the switch between the mostly serious main story and the wacky side-stories, but a lot of Kiwami’s side-stories are dull. A lot of the side-stories just involve Kiryu getting scammed before getting revenge, which while fun the first time starts to feel stale the 5th or 6th time. 

Kiwami is still really good, but it does feel like a weaker game than 0.

The whole phenomenon of AAA games like Dragon Age Inquisition getting great reviews, but later being seen as subpar definitely speaks to recency bias. Also, I feel like we've yet to develop a good vocabulary to write about games with, which is why journos tend to default to talking about story and aesthetic - people know how to write about those, whereas the terms we use for gameplay (crunchy, tight, visceral) have been abused to the point they mean almost nothing. Although I think this is less of an issue for more rules-based games. I've seen some very good articles talking about mechanics in Slay the Spire, for example.

That's largely why I tend to find the only good writing in games journalism tends to come in thinkpieces about aesthetics, story, politics, etc. The base for discussing those is wellfounded, and liberal arts educations prime you to write about that sort of thing almost regardless of what degree you have.

I can't stand 30fps, it's distracting and makes fast-paced games genuinely harder to play and just less fun overall. I've still powered through a lot of games in spite of this (mostly console exclusives) but I've also dropped a few because of it. It varies.

As others have said, consistency is really important too. I've been playing Dragon Age Inquisition lately and it drives me crazy because all the cutscenes are capped at 30fps when the rest of the game isn't. The constant switching is far more annoying than if the game was just capped at 30 at all times.

At the end of the day it just comes down to what you're used to. Tons of people play exclusively on console and are totally fine with 30fps because they're accustomed to it. Other people just aren't picky. Nothing wrong with that ",1546452891,1,1546449291.0,Dragon Age,0.99794954

Same with Bethesda. They put out Fallout 4, I loved it (even though the fanbase in general wasn't super impressed in comparison with older titles), then put out Fallout 76, it's a total piece of shit. So now I'm on the outs with Bethesda too. 

But if Bioware puts out Anthem and I check it out post-launch and it seems to be getting high praise, I'll buy it. If Bethesda puts out Starfield and it is a good game, I'll buy it.

1801,123,Fynriel,"&gt; What game does? All AAA games are derivative

I don't think that's true at all. What stands out to me as derivative is open world content formulas, quest design and the like. But the worlds we inhabit are completely different. AAA games that are indeed very cookie cutter stand out from the crowd. You see that same third person stealth mechanic where you hide in ""hiding spots"" and casually clear out an enemy camp in a lot of games. That's derivative, yes. It diminishes many games' unique settings with generic content and a copy/paste approach to level and quest design. *That* I will grant you. But the worlds themselves are unique. And looking specifically at the big MMO shooters, Destiny and the Division, I strongly feel that both have a unique identity. Visually, concerning setting, narratively, and mechanically. Just not in terms of content design perhaps. Anthem doesn't feel unique in the former categories, either, however.

It also feels like a mockery of modern game tropes. And that may not necessarily be its own fault. It may be timing thing. For example: We've had so many of these generic player character descriptors - like 'Guardian' in Destiny. And BioWare in particular LOVES those: in Mass Effect we were a 'Spectre', in Dragon Age a 'Warden', in Andromeda they chose 'Pathfinder'. Somehow all these games until now have gotten away with it if their title at least sounded somewhat unique. But excuse me, ""Freelancer""? Seriously. It sounds soooo uninventive. And at this point in time it elicists a huge eye roll reaction from the audience. Like ""Oh, it's what you call your Guardians, how creative...."" It has almost become comical at this point I feel. It's kind of a gaming trope now. And Anthem just comes across with its own version of that, completely unironically. It's more than a bit cringey.

And honestly, to me it's the core ingredients that differentiate it from Destiny and The Division. You can lob all the critique in the world at Destiny's launch and The Division's launch, both were disastrous, and you can also criticize the mess that it Destiny's store like I said. But the core ingredients they originally created...I mean Joseph Staten is an incredible worldbuilder. Before all the stuff that happened behind the scenes where they rebooted the whole story 6 months before release, the writing staff created something that was, in my opinion, as deep and engaging as Halo. This is especially noticable with names. Bungie has always been spectacular when it comes to naming things: Characters, ships, places. They all somehow become instantly iconic. Now Anthem...like I already alluded to with the Freelancer thing, BioWare seems to have failed utterly and naming the elements of the world something memorable. And again, it may simply be a timing thing, but the entire premise of Anthem seems sooo been there done that. I didn't have that feeling with Destiny. The Hive lore seemed really intriguing. There's a sub called Destinylore. Now I'll bet you 1000 bucks there will never be an Anthemlore, because it will never capture people's imagination in the same way.

David Gaider, formerly of Bioware, described the writing style for Dragon Age games many times on his blog, and part of that is that they did exactly that: editors had their own characters that they wrote for, and everything that character said went by them.

Making a mainstream single box genre game with a fixed known budget is easy, and has no long tail costs. 

For the price of one modern good MMO you can probably fund 6 or so box games, one takes off and now it's a license to print money. 

Even ""dragon age"" is a biyearly seller. (4 games since 2009). 

Unless you're a huge player (and again, they All already have an MMO and don't want to cannibalize their playerbase) making a ""good MMO"" is bet the company money. 

Wow was 200$ million to make, FFXIV was 400$ million (made twice). That's *just* to develop, not to market. 

For 200 million you can pull the slot machine arm on *four different possible future franchises* (~50mil Dev cost is the current industry average for midmarket games). 

How many studios even put out four games a year? 

How many of those don't have an MMO?

1830,152,Fynriel,"&gt; What game does? All AAA games are derivative

I don't think that's true at all. What stands out to me as derivative is open world content formulas, quest design and the like. But the worlds we inhabit are completely different. AAA games that are indeed very cookie cutter stand out from the crowd. You see that same third person stealth mechanic where you hide in ""hiding spots"" and casually clear out an enemy camp in a lot of games. That's derivative, yes. It diminishes many games' unique settings with generic content and a copy/paste approach to level and quest design. *That* I will grant you. But the worlds themselves are unique. And looking specifically at the big MMO shooters, Destiny and the Division, I strongly feel that both have a unique identity. Visually, concerning setting, narratively, and mechanically. Just not in terms of content design perhaps. Anthem doesn't feel unique in the former categories, either, however.

It also feels like a mockery of modern game tropes. And that may not necessarily be its own fault. It may be timing thing. For example: We've had so many of these generic player character descriptors - like 'Guardian' in Destiny. And BioWare in particular LOVES those: in Mass Effect we were a 'Spectre', in Dragon Age a 'Warden', in Andromeda they chose 'Pathfinder'. Somehow all these games until now have gotten away with it if their title at least sounded somewhat unique. But excuse me, ""Freelancer""? Seriously. It sounds soooo uninventive. And at this point in time it elicists a huge eye roll reaction from the audience. Like ""Oh, it's what you call your Guardians, how creative...."" It has almost become comical at this point I feel. It's kind of a gaming trope now. And Anthem just comes across with its own version of that, completely unironically. It's more than a bit cringey.

And honestly, to me it's the core ingredients that differentiate it from Destiny and The Division. You can lob all the critique in the world at Destiny's launch and The Division's launch, both were disastrous, and you can also criticize the mess that it Destiny's store like I said. But the core ingredients they originally created...I mean Joseph Staten is an incredible worldbuilder. Before all the stuff that happened behind the scenes where they rebooted the whole story 6 months before release, the writing staff created something that was, in my opinion, as deep and engaging as Halo. This is especially noticable with names. Bungie has always been spectacular when it comes to naming things: Characters, ships, places. They all somehow become instantly iconic. Now Anthem...like I already alluded to with the Freelancer thing, BioWare seems to have failed utterly and naming the elements of the world something memorable. And again, it may simply be a timing thing, but the entire premise of Anthem seems sooo been there done that. I didn't have that feeling with Destiny. The Hive lore seemed really intriguing. There's a sub called Destinylore. Now I'll bet you 1000 bucks there will never be an Anthemlore, because it will never capture people's imagination in the same way.

1860,182,Fynriel,"&gt; What game does? All AAA games are derivative

I don't think that's true at all. What stands out to me as derivative is open world content formulas, quest design and the like. But the worlds we inhabit are completely different. AAA games that are indeed very cookie cutter stand out from the crowd. You see that same third person stealth mechanic where you hide in ""hiding spots"" and casually clear out an enemy camp in a lot of games. That's derivative, yes. It diminishes many games' unique settings with generic content and a copy/paste approach to level and quest design. *That* I will grant you. But the worlds themselves are unique. And looking specifically at the big MMO shooters, Destiny and the Division, I strongly feel that both have a unique identity. Visually, concerning setting, narratively, and mechanically. Just not in terms of content design perhaps. Anthem doesn't feel unique in the former categories, either, however.

It also feels like a mockery of modern game tropes. And that may not necessarily be its own fault. It may be timing thing. For example: We've had so many of these generic player character descriptors - like 'Guardian' in Destiny. And BioWare in particular LOVES those: in Mass Effect we were a 'Spectre', in Dragon Age a 'Warden', in Andromeda they chose 'Pathfinder'. Somehow all these games until now have gotten away with it if their title at least sounded somewhat unique. But excuse me, ""Freelancer""? Seriously. It sounds soooo uninventive. And at this point in time it elicists a huge eye roll reaction from the audience. Like ""Oh, it's what you call your Guardians, how creative...."" It has almost become comical at this point I feel. It's kind of a gaming trope now. And Anthem just comes across with its own version of that, completely unironically. It's more than a bit cringey.

And honestly, to me it's the core ingredients that differentiate it from Destiny and The Division. You can lob all the critique in the world at Destiny's launch and The Division's launch, both were disastrous, and you can also criticize the mess that it Destiny's store like I said. But the core ingredients they originally created...I mean Joseph Staten is an incredible worldbuilder. Before all the stuff that happened behind the scenes where they rebooted the whole story 6 months before release, the writing staff created something that was, in my opinion, as deep and engaging as Halo. This is especially noticable with names. Bungie has always been spectacular when it comes to naming things: Characters, ships, places. They all somehow become instantly iconic. Now Anthem...like I already alluded to with the Freelancer thing, BioWare seems to have failed utterly and naming the elements of the world something memorable. And again, it may simply be a timing thing, but the entire premise of Anthem seems sooo been there done that. I didn't have that feeling with Destiny. The Hive lore seemed really intriguing. There's a sub called Destinylore. Now I'll bet you 1000 bucks there will never be an Anthemlore, because it will never capture people's imagination in the same way.

Titanfall 2 was a good example of this. It's probably only 5 hours long if that (on the short side but of course this is just the campaign) but it's fun the whole way through and never sags, which was incredibly surprising because that is not what you expect from a AAA multiplayer game's campaign mode.

While I don't mind putting in 20+ hours to a game that I am really gonna enjoy, most of the time I would rather be able to play something and finish it in 6-10 hours and move on. It's nice to have more available if I want to keep playing - I'd love to have a game I can finish in 10 hours but get 100 hours of play out of in general if I feel like it - but most games aren't built that because they want gamers to experience everything the game has to offer in their first playthrough (since most won't even finish that, let alone come back for a second one).",1546615575,1,1546611975.0,Titanfall,0.99877733

No regrets on either. But if I had to pick a console I played more... it would be the Xbox One. 

Why?

Playstation has the best exclusives. Easily. More JRPGs. But best multiplayer?

Xbox One has:

- Titanfall (better than Titanfall 2, probably played it daily from 2014-2015)
- Halo 5 (mediocre campaign, AMAZING Arena/Forge/Warzone)
- Gears of War remastered + 4 (nothing really like it elsewhere)
- Forza Horizon 2-3-4 
- Backwards compatibility (Red Dead Redemption, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Halo Reach)

Your mileage may vary, but I've got more use out of backwards compatibility + the multiplayer games than I did out of the PS4. 

Call of Duty, Destiny, Rocket League were the big multiplayer titles on PS4. But they're cross platform titles. 

Just saying its a matter of perspective. 

3rd party titles play best on the Xbox One X. And Microsoft is committed to bakcwards compatibiltiy, which gives me a huge confidence boost buying games digitally with them.

Titanfall 2 was a good example of this. It's probably only 5 hours long if that (on the short side but of course this is just the campaign) but it's fun the whole way through and never sags, which was incredibly surprising because that is not what you expect from a AAA multiplayer game's campaign mode.

While I don't mind putting in 20+ hours to a game that I am really gonna enjoy, most of the time I would rather be able to play something and finish it in 6-10 hours and move on. It's nice to have more available if I want to keep playing - I'd love to have a game I can finish in 10 hours but get 100 hours of play out of in general if I feel like it - but most games aren't built that because they want gamers to experience everything the game has to offer in their first playthrough (since most won't even finish that, let alone come back for a second one).",1546615575,1,1546611975.0,Titanfall,0.99877733

I've talked about this before in the Dead Space sub, but the math is pretty simple.  We made DS1, and it sold *okay*.  We thought if we made something similar, but polished and taken to the next level, that'd get us a bigger audience (keep in mind these games are expensive to make).  So we did, and again, it sold *okay*.  In our research, people told us that the #1 reason why people bought Dead Space was because it was scary, but the #1 reason why people DIDN'T buy it was because it was scary.

So, making the same game again, but better, wasn't an option.  We had tried that.  We also had this scary/not scary problem.  So our idea was to add in elegantly integrated drop-in/drop-out co-op, because then we'd have the single player game, but also you could bring a friend along, and that would be less scary if you wanted.  Largely I think they succeeded in this and some of the co-op sections are really great.  The game also looks really good.

Overall, I think the changes grew the audience, but alienated about the same amount of people, and muddied the vision of the franchise.",1547004926,1,1547001326.0,Dead Space,0.0002891234

As I got new abilities, I couldn't help comparing them to stuff like Metroid's Space Jump and Screw Attack, or Ori's Bash, abilities which were incredibly exciting and majorly altered your moveset. HK's are quite pedestrian by comparison. A wall-jump here, a double-jump there, a charge attack... They all feel nice to use, but they're also very familiar. The super dash is cool, but the fact that it gets stopped dead by enemies makes it pretty hard to use outside of designated areas. I think I understand why this was done, to an extent - HK is much more open and non-linear than those games so it can't afford to have as much linear power progression. But I still wish the power-ups had been a bit more interesting.

**Monster Hunter World**: Some aspects of the online system, especially the bizarre restriction on cutscenes, which took me 30+ minutes of confusion and googling to figure out on release and is still an annoyance after you figure it out. Not being able to rejoin a hunt after disconnecting also sucks, as does the lack of support for duo hunting (monster health is the same from 2 to 4 players). Also, the RNG for decorations and weapon streamstones is a bit much. Oh yeah, and the weird insistence on drip-feeding tiny amounts of layered armor. At least that one can be fixed by mods.

**Celeste**: The first (?) screen of the Temple C-side demanded an infuriating level of precision. That's honestly my sole criticism of the game. I also may have just been doing it wrong...

**Subnautica**: I wish there was a practical way to fight Leviathans. Just because it would have been fun. The performance also left something to be desired at times. And I wish the lava area was a bit less linear - dragging my Cyclops between the alien facility down there and my base in the caves above got pretty tedious.

1952,21,Shaqsquatch,"Wormholes are one of the most interesting areas of EVE with some of the lowest exposure because of how different they are from the rest of EVE (also scanning is a pain in the ass and WH life requires a lot of it). I lived in one for a brief time but the most fun I had with Wormholes was a project our alliance called the Fury Road. 

Most non-Wormhole space in EVE is navigated using fixed Stargates to move between systems, which gives space a bit of geography (you can have dead end systems or mostly isolated systems where you can get a bit of warning that enemies are approaching from a few gates away). However, capital ships in EVE have jump drives that let them directly jump between systems to a player activated or static beacons, bypassing gates. In addition, Titans (the largest supercapital ships) are capable of opening bridges that allow subcapital ships to jump to these beacons using the Titan's jump drives. In the past, this allowed for alliances to travel around the galaxy rapidly by setting up networks of these beacons to chain together sequential jumps. 

CCP (somewhat rightfully) nerfed this, adding an exponentially increasing cooldown timer after jumps. This had the result of making conflicts in EVE much more local. If you were on the opposite side of the galaxy from a hostile group, they couldn't really get to you quickly (large scale move ops and deployments usually take days to weeks and give plenty of advance warning to the targets). Shortly after this was implemented, our alliance set up a program with a dedicated group of scanners and WH residents to maintain a close to real-time map of the Wormholes as they appeared and collapsed. We then used this map to launch surprise attacks all over the galaxy, as there was no limit on wormhole use like there was on jump drives. Some of the most fun I had in that game was suddenly appearing out of nowhere on the other side of the galaxy in a smallish pack of cruisers to wreak some havoc and then disappearing back through the wormholes just as quickly.",1547067218,1,1547063618.0,Dead Space,0.028435824

Sometimes there might be something that comes out of the myst but it just confirms your suspicions and it's still terrifying.

1966,35,ImHidingInYourPants,"**Super Smash Bros Ultimate** -

The single player stuff grew tedious pretty quickly for me. It's fun to see all the different spirits and the setups for spirit battles, but they rarely feel like more than a simple AI match and the gimmicks usually don't play into the fight in a big way. At first it was fun to customize my spirit set up for every fight and switch to every new character I unlocked, but at this point I'm just using Samus with the strongest spirits a few good secondaries attached to make the kills quick. The volume of fights is nice, but I would have preferred less content that was more unique. As something to slowly beat in 20 minute chunks of play when you're salty at an online loss it's a neat diversion, but if you're thinking of getting smash solely as a single player experience I honestly wouldn't recommend it.

That being said Smash is still a great party game with friends and competitive experience if you want that too. Even with how awful GSP is as a ranking system and how you're only suggesting the style of game you want to play and hoping you match with someone with similar preferences I'm enjoying playing online. Smash may not be execution heavy, but I've gotten into the metagame of setting up mind games and traps and reading opponents more than I ever have before. The feeling of pulling through a hard fought match with a perfect read is fantastic and it makes me better understand why people love fighters.

**Earth Defense Force 4.1: The Shadow of New Despair**

If you're not familiar with Earth Defense Force it's the video game equivalent of a cheesy b-movie. They're third person shooters with an emphasis on dozens of enemies on the screen at once and since it's based on schlocky 50s sci-fi those enemies are giant insects and retro style UFOs and robots. The games are not good, but they're low-budget in an endearing way and they fill a niche of shooting hoards of brain dead enemies in a big 3D space that no one else really does.

That being said D3 publisher somewhere along the way stopped thinking of this as a budget series of games without doing anything to justify a full retail price. I played EDF on the 360 and this is almost the same fucking game I played a decade ago. They've added a couple classes, but the enemies have all been the same, if the cityscapes aren't exactly the same the differences are negligible, the menus are hideous and a chore to do anything in, the game is glitchy and me and my three friends have all had issues. The price has dropped down to $19.99 on steam since the original release and I'd be hesitant to recommend it at that. 

People really have an affection for these games, and while I appreciate the jank as an essential part of the experience the fact that this launched at $50 seems like straight up exploiting a loyal group of fans.",1546895297,1,1546891697.0,Dead Space,0.009009085

The space station feels so oppressive with the constant humming of environmental control, flickering lights, the alien rumbling around the vents and so on.

Sure the Alien itself is scary but if it gets at you, you're dead anyway. It's the near constant stress of anticipation that really gets you.

And it's such a beautiful game visually. Every detail feels like it fits right into the original Alien movie.

The first time I saw the alien, I nearly got myself killed because I just stood there slack jawed as it slowly lowered itself from a ceiling vent. Slowly unrolling itself until it stood a good seven feet tall.

There are side quests out there too, in separate segments of the ship that have been blown apart and stranded out in space as well.

I'm not sure if I'm overselling it or not but I really really thought this part of the game was amazing. You, being an engineer, actually engineering, flying around and exploring and doing a Dead Space again. Flying through space and getting ambushed by those tentacle baby things. It was awesome.

I think it could arguably be one of the scariest just because it takes control away from the player in rare way and the stress is more prolonged than ""OMG bad guys just popped up!""

A simple mod to replace the EDI skin with something more akin to the android from Metropolis would be such an easy fix too.)

  
But the thing is, lot of other things are great, and I love those things more than I hate the bad things.  Basically, the difference between why I think the whole series is good and why others think the whole series is bad is mostly not because we disagree about what is good or bad, it's because we weight those things differently.

Likewise, I can't dispute that especially in ME3 the overarching official plot is weak, makes little sense, is a constant influx of fighting stupid terrorist space marines over and over again, but goddam it's all worth it for those companion missions, for resolving the issue of the genophage,  for helping Mordin fix his mistake, for ending the Quarian/Geth conflict, for the Leviathan and Citadel DLC.  For me, I even saw the threads of ""the whole story is about AI/organic conflict"" running through from the first game so that being the underlying source of the reaper storyline didn't bother me at all.  


Having said that, one thing that blew my mind by the time I got to the end of this ""novel"" retrospective of the series was realizing that he's evaluating the entire finale of the series with key companions dead or missing.

The single player stuff grew tedious pretty quickly for me. It's fun to see all the different spirits and the setups for spirit battles, but they rarely feel like more than a simple AI match and the gimmicks usually don't play into the fight in a big way. At first it was fun to customize my spirit set up for every fight and switch to every new character I unlocked, but at this point I'm just using Samus with the strongest spirits a few good secondaries attached to make the kills quick. The volume of fights is nice, but I would have preferred less content that was more unique. As something to slowly beat in 20 minute chunks of play when you're salty at an online loss it's a neat diversion, but if you're thinking of getting smash solely as a single player experience I honestly wouldn't recommend it.

That being said Smash is still a great party game with friends and competitive experience if you want that too. Even with how awful GSP is as a ranking system and how you're only suggesting the style of game you want to play and hoping you match with someone with similar preferences I'm enjoying playing online. Smash may not be execution heavy, but I've gotten into the metagame of setting up mind games and traps and reading opponents more than I ever have before. The feeling of pulling through a hard fought match with a perfect read is fantastic and it makes me better understand why people love fighters.

**Earth Defense Force 4.1: The Shadow of New Despair**

If you're not familiar with Earth Defense Force it's the video game equivalent of a cheesy b-movie. They're third person shooters with an emphasis on dozens of enemies on the screen at once and since it's based on schlocky 50s sci-fi those enemies are giant insects and retro style UFOs and robots. The games are not good, but they're low-budget in an endearing way and they fill a niche of shooting hoards of brain dead enemies in a big 3D space that no one else really does.

That being said D3 publisher somewhere along the way stopped thinking of this as a budget series of games without doing anything to justify a full retail price. I played EDF on the 360 and this is almost the same fucking game I played a decade ago. They've added a couple classes, but the enemies have all been the same, if the cityscapes aren't exactly the same the differences are negligible, the menus are hideous and a chore to do anything in, the game is glitchy and me and my three friends have all had issues. The price has dropped down to $19.99 on steam since the original release and I'd be hesitant to recommend it at that. 

People really have an affection for these games, and while I appreciate the jank as an essential part of the experience the fact that this launched at $50 seems like straight up exploiting a loyal group of fans.",1546895297,1,1546891697.0,Dead Space,0.009009085

A lot of companies like Square seen to have the attitude that ""if we throw enough money at it, it will generate that ratio of money back!"", which just won't happen in every case.

These points can be used to buy packages with players, although you don't know what you'll get. ""That's gambling,"" says the Belgian gambling commission.
These FIFA points can be used to purchase so-called 'ultimate team packages' in the game. These are digital surprise packages or loot boxes with well-known players. On the EA site you can even find the probability per category of player. The better the player, the smaller the chance.

EA always shroudedly called it 'a way of playing' or 'pin dynamics', but since you can not only win FIFA points, but can also buy them with real money, that's clearly 'gambling', according to the Belgian gambling commission. EA says it is ""disappointed"". ""Although we are taking this step, we don't agree with the Belgian authorities' interpretation of the law and we're still looking for more clarity on this"", it sounds in a communication. ""The impact of this change on FIFA Ultimate Team in Belgium has no material impact on our financial performance.

The creator of the game alludes that the revenues from these surprise packages are small. A small survey among advanced players shows that 'bought team' with such packages can quickly cost 5,000 euros.

Figures show that EA generates about 67 percent of all revenues, about 3 billion euros, from digital sales. According to business magazine Forbes, the share of 'surprise packages' in this is crucial.

Anyone who in the past 'won' or 'bought' players in this way may keep it that way. ""Players still have access to the Ultimate Team game mode and can continue playing with their current players.

They are the people who drive social media sentiment, are always talking about the company's games, and create content to keep people engaged (via YouTube or blogs, fanart, and wild speculation about the next game). 

Having a loyal fanbase and keeping them happy by simply acknowledging they exist and being vaguely transparent about what's going to happen next can be enormously beneficial to companies even if it doesn't show up in sales reports. Fans create free marketing, and announcements like Nintendo's yesterday cost nothing except a small amount of disappointment which is generally greatly outweighed by the gratitude of fans at actually being acknowledged for once instead of being treated like random people who walk into a store to buy a game because the box looked cool.

Both the initial announcement of the title drop and this announcement of delay respected and acknowledged long time fans, while companies like EA and Activision-Blizzard tactlessly handle the Star Wars and Diablo franchises and irk fans when they get treated like stupid children.

2090,55,vhqr,"For those at work:

Well folks, this is it!  It was a little over 6 years ago that we first started working on Anthem, and we’re down to exactly one month left until launch.

Back in 2012 when we first conceived of Anthem (then codenamed DYLAN), we wanted to create a whole new fictional universe, full of BioWare quality story and character.  We also wanted it to be an experience you could share with friends, and to have a story that doesn’t just come to an end, but takes place in a world where things are happening right now.  

We knew there would be challenges.  People are skeptical of the idea of story in an online game, and for good reason.  Often, the nature of online multiplayer games tends to fight story agency and interesting character interactions.  And, even in the best online games, it’s easy to lose interest or run out of things to do when your friends aren’t online.

We designed Anthem to address these design challenges by trying something new and different.  With Anthem, we aim to integrate the fun of multiplayer missions with your friends, and single-player story agency and characters, into a connected narrative experience – set in a world designed to be always changing, and where anything is possible.  The result is an intentionally unique structure which is fundamental to Anthem’s design and even the universe it’s set in.

Anthem will launch with a ton of content, including a substantial main story that introduces you to the world and its characters.  But there’s still a missing ingredient that we haven’t been able to test Anthem with: you.  So, over the next month as you start to have opportunities to try what we’ve created, I ask you to keep one thing in mind: The launch of Anthem is not the end – it’s the beginning of an ongoing story in which you are a critical element.  If there’s something you want more of, we can build it.  If something isn’t right, let us know.  And the story itself will unfold over time based on how you play the game.  Soon, we will reveal more about our plans for how we intend to support that ongoing stream of content and features.

But when can you play?  We are just days away from the first of several opportunities you’ll have to jump into Anthem and try it for yourself:

​

    If you have pre-ordered or are an active EA Access subscriber, you’ll be able to participate in the VIP demo starting January 25.
    Then, on February 1, the open demo goes live and everyone will be able to spend the weekend playing Anthem.
    If you subscribe to Origin Access Premier you’ll be able to start playing the full game through Early Access on February 15. Or you can play the first 10 hours on the same day through the Play First Trial.
    And finally, our worldwide launch date is February 22!

I’ll be spending a lot of time in the world of Anthem myself.  I hope to see you there!

If anything EA has been so hands off that they had difficulties sorting out the leadership between studios. Activision and Ubisoft did this so handily, not with EA. At one point Jade Raymond seemed to have attempted a Ubisoft style of multi-studio development at Motive Montreal, but now that she quit, looks like it didn't work out.

EA just has too many big names with big powers on too many studios. I believe it was one of the biggest reasons the time hasn't been kind for them for years. Games are getting bigger, efforts need to be consolidated and centralized, which hasn't been EA's best trait for years. See Mass Effect Andromeda. The Montreal team was queasy about Edmonton input even when they were in trouble.

Which is to say it looks better nowadays. Bio Montreal and a sizeable chunk of EA Vancouver was shifted to Motive. Bioware consolidated a large part of Austin team to work alongside Edmonton with Anthem.

talk is one thing, ea studios have a habit of talking and dragging their feet (look at this whole debacle with battlefield v).

the major fucky problems of the game being practically unplayable should have been addressed far earlier than a public preorder demo going out.

there is no excuse for these games of this level of budget to constantly release as broken as they are, and this seems like it might follow the same trend of fallout 76 and battlefield v in this regard.

2167,132,vhqr,"For those at work:

Well folks, this is it!  It was a little over 6 years ago that we first started working on Anthem, and we’re down to exactly one month left until launch.

Back in 2012 when we first conceived of Anthem (then codenamed DYLAN), we wanted to create a whole new fictional universe, full of BioWare quality story and character.  We also wanted it to be an experience you could share with friends, and to have a story that doesn’t just come to an end, but takes place in a world where things are happening right now.  

We knew there would be challenges.  People are skeptical of the idea of story in an online game, and for good reason.  Often, the nature of online multiplayer games tends to fight story agency and interesting character interactions.  And, even in the best online games, it’s easy to lose interest or run out of things to do when your friends aren’t online.

We designed Anthem to address these design challenges by trying something new and different.  With Anthem, we aim to integrate the fun of multiplayer missions with your friends, and single-player story agency and characters, into a connected narrative experience – set in a world designed to be always changing, and where anything is possible.  The result is an intentionally unique structure which is fundamental to Anthem’s design and even the universe it’s set in.

Anthem will launch with a ton of content, including a substantial main story that introduces you to the world and its characters.  But there’s still a missing ingredient that we haven’t been able to test Anthem with: you.  So, over the next month as you start to have opportunities to try what we’ve created, I ask you to keep one thing in mind: The launch of Anthem is not the end – it’s the beginning of an ongoing story in which you are a critical element.  If there’s something you want more of, we can build it.  If something isn’t right, let us know.  And the story itself will unfold over time based on how you play the game.  Soon, we will reveal more about our plans for how we intend to support that ongoing stream of content and features.

But when can you play?  We are just days away from the first of several opportunities you’ll have to jump into Anthem and try it for yourself:

​

    If you have pre-ordered or are an active EA Access subscriber, you’ll be able to participate in the VIP demo starting January 25.
    Then, on February 1, the open demo goes live and everyone will be able to spend the weekend playing Anthem.
    If you subscribe to Origin Access Premier you’ll be able to start playing the full game through Early Access on February 15. Or you can play the first 10 hours on the same day through the Play First Trial.
    And finally, our worldwide launch date is February 22!

I’ll be spending a lot of time in the world of Anthem myself.  I hope to see you there!

If anything EA has been so hands off that they had difficulties sorting out the leadership between studios. Activision and Ubisoft did this so handily, not with EA. At one point Jade Raymond seemed to have attempted a Ubisoft style of multi-studio development at Motive Montreal, but now that she quit, looks like it didn't work out.

EA just has too many big names with big powers on too many studios. I believe it was one of the biggest reasons the time hasn't been kind for them for years. Games are getting bigger, efforts need to be consolidated and centralized, which hasn't been EA's best trait for years. See Mass Effect Andromeda. The Montreal team was queasy about Edmonton input even when they were in trouble.

Which is to say it looks better nowadays. Bio Montreal and a sizeable chunk of EA Vancouver was shifted to Motive. Bioware consolidated a large part of Austin team to work alongside Edmonton with Anthem. Criterion is more or less a support team for now but who knows if and when Ghost Games execs will be sacked and the studio comes under Guildford leadership. Frostbite outgrowing DICE.

You are still just buying a game. Just like buying a game that's buggy on release is a bad idea, because there is zero guarantee those bugs will be fixed, it's a bad idea to buy an EA game and expect it to turn into something more refined/better/finished. If you aren't interested in the game as it currently exists, don't buy it.

If the devs don't have enough resources to get a game into a playable and fun state before asking money for it via EA, it's virtually guaranteed EA won't magically give them the resources (in terms of money and skills) they need to finish it. EA works well when it's used to sustain a development team that obviously knows what they're doing, has a release plan, and (most importantly) has a game that's already fun and close to finished. Maybe they've gotten the game 90% there but need an influx of cash to allow them to add that final 10% of polish. It's the same for Kickstarter.

But studios who expect to use EA to pay for the entire development process, or who release a 'game' in EA that's actually nothing more than a prototype, are setting themselves up for failure.

I've been playing the game since it bit ea and quit shortly after Miramar dropped, and the game went ""live."" They don't care about hackers. They care about making low-effort changes to the game so they can keep the game relevant for longer. The Chinese business model for mobile games is to constantly appeal to new players and not bother to support the game in a truly meaningful way because retention is expensive and doesn't generate the same level of profit. Look up who owns the game. It will tell  you a whole lot. Retaining an eSports title occasionally requires doing something like this, but it's not a hard line at all. It's something that should have happened a long time ago, and is a token effort. There's tons of hacking in the game and they know it. The entire reason they won't region lock the game is because Chinese players won't spend money if all they're doing is playing other hackers in their region.

To compete with Steam, you would have to offer a better service on a game that's also available with Steam.  If you don't do that, you've created a ""closed garden"" store just like the Apple Store, XBox and Playstation exclusives.  Exclusives don't make your store competitive.  It makes it exclusive.  


There's nothing more cash-grab than a PUBG clone and paying devs to only release on your platform.    


We could have easily replaced you with an EA Origin apologist and you would have said the exact same thing.  Nobody cares about Steam exclusives.  People care about games that are available on multiple stores.

Gatcha games are scummy for the tactics they use. 

That is the point I am making. I'm sure EA has great explainations for FIFA and Battlefront 2's monitization methods as well, but most people agree that they are scummy. Do you think that FIFA and Battlefront 2 and other ""worse"" gatcha methods are A-ok because well people will buy them? Is Facebook immune from criticism because people still ise the service despite it's flaws? 

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

I've been playing the game since it bit ea and quit shortly after Miramar dropped, and the game went ""live."" They don't care about hackers. They care about making low-effort changes to the game so they can keep the game relevant for longer. The Chinese business model for mobile games is to constantly appeal to new players and not bother to support the game in a truly meaningful way because retention is expensive and doesn't generate the same level of profit. Look up who owns the game. It will tell  you a whole lot. Retaining an eSports title occasionally requires doing something like this, but it's not a hard line at all. It's something that should have happened a long time ago, and is a token effort. There's tons of hacking in the game and they know it. The entire reason they won't region lock the game is because Chinese players won't spend money if all they're doing is playing other hackers in their region.

If they really wanted to fix the game, they'd fix it. At present, all the important shit is clientside and the netcode is an attrocious mess, just like it was at launch.

Instead it was a PR disaster, a big hit for the franchise, and proof that the people at the studio were pushing it out the door before it was ready, despite the fact that EA had not only offered a delay, but had actually *mentioned the possibility of a delay to its investors*. That's a high level failure, and it proved that the studio wasn't working.

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

Call of Duty makes money hand over fist but that wasn’t enough. They attempt to “be the good guy, look no loot boxes “ for black ops 4. A game without a campaign, a premium dlc pass, and microtransaction based progression for unlocks . They say you can unlock stuff by just playing, but it’s designed to be a sloggy grind to get the weapons near the end of the supply stream. So they fill the loot pool with trash , incentivizing skipping tiers. So obviously the game is going to under perform on the delivery, it’s not just about making money, it’s about making more money. And now the hammer is coming down on call of duty. So Bungie probably acted in a defensive claim to Activisions claim of Destiny under performing . Bungie May have had a clause stating that Activisions business practices harmed the final product and reception , making the full relinquishing of rights easier to claim. The whole thing is a gamble for Bungie but so far support wise I think they did the right thing for not just Destiny , but any game they make from here on out . Usually companies don’t leave the big boys with their limbs intact. They shut down as an empty husk. Thrown to the piles of Maxis, Westwood, Vicarious , Visceral etc. It’s becoming clear in the new AAA market that you do not need publishers as much as the market used to. Digital delivery is massive, corporate practices hurt game development and quality . Battlefield used to be a big series (still is ) but that brand is now being tarnished due to EA. Same with BioWares new game. The first thing people say now is they don’t trust BioWare because it’s being published by EA.

Epic has zero leverage here. They have no market share, no services, nothing. They have some cash they're willing to burn, but otherwise they have nothing. 

So the idea that Epic ""forced"" Coffee Stain to not be in Steam is just ridiculous and it's why I wanted to refute it.  It's why I do get hung up on the word.

People are conflating a lot of issues here and I feel like they are dumping a disproportionate amount of hate on Epic and trying to paint it out like the developers aren't to blame when they take these deals. The deals are optional, the developers willfully agree to them, and Epic has no real weight in making anyone accept it other than waving a big fat check in the developer's face. 

&gt;They're being the bully to consumers. ""You want this game, well you have to get it from us because we paid the developers off.""

Ha, no. Coffee Stain said that. Not Epic. 

Over the years people have said leveled a lot of anti-consumer accusations at Valve. From their custom service, return policy, their attempt to monetize mods. They are hardly saints and while they may not have paid for an ""exclusive"", they have definitely thrown their weight around more than Epic has. And that applies to the way they treat developers as well (announcing a fee drop for only the biggest, best selling games was gross in my opinion. ""Valve takes more from the little guy!

2405,370,Eurehetemec,"&gt; Don't use children, gambling addicts, etc as a shield. Just be honest and say why  YOU don't want loot boxes.

The issue with this is that those are legitimate reasons, and you're saying people can discuss them, because in your opinion:

&gt; I bet more than half of the people making that claim don't give a fuck about the ""kids""

I think you'd be pretty surprised at how wrong you were about that. It's an evidence-free assertion that ""most people who disagree with me are liars!"", which is pretty terrible. If you're assuming everyone but people who agree with you are arguing in bad faith, then you're basically acting in bad faith yourself.

Personally I wasn't worried about FIFA UT, for example, until I heard about how obsessed the kids of some parents I know get with it. The parents pay enough attention to limit the kids to spending their pocket money and not doing anything terrible, generally, but it's still making the kids absolutely fucking obsessed with opening these random packs, and I dunno, I don't think that's great, especially for long-term development.

I also think it's pretty clear EA is marketing intentionally to kids with FUT, which is also pretty shit.",1547543696,1,1547540096.0,EA,0.06276542

2420,385,cola-up,"&gt;Even so, I thought about this last night.

&gt;Activision has jumped ship.

&gt;EA has long ago jumped ship.

&gt;Ubisoft jumped ship with Division 2 and likely moving forward with other games unless something changes that hurts them badly financially.

&gt;Bethesda has apparently jumped ship as of Fallout 76 with RAGE 2 and Doom Eternal having no Steam page in sight.

&gt;Take-Two hasn't yet, but I can't see it not happening.

&gt;Other than indies (though that's hit and miss with EPIC's $$$ flying around for exclusives), WB, THQ, Devolver, CD Projekt, etc. it's getting slim pickings on Steam from a AAA standpoint.

&gt;I hope everyone loves having 6-10 logins, friends lists, etc. because that's the land we're in now.

Ubisoft already mentioned it was select games, and EA, Activision only provide single IP's on steam. Bethesda as far as I know is going to be coming back, as the Beth.Net launcher was a absolute garbage pile and RAGE 2 is gonna sell less then 1000 copies on PC from how it's looking.

Ubisoft doesn't care they are testing the waters atm. Plus they have uPlay. Take-Two has Rockstar Social Club. Epic is only going for games people know. Or publishers being paid. That's all.

2425,390,Muesli_nom,"&gt; But personally I'm fairly optimistic and I've enjoyed a hell of a lot more games this year that did right by me as a consumers than ones that didn't.

Yeah, same here - there's a lot of good practices around, they're just not found with the biggest companies. I think if we talked more about games that do stuff right instead of talking about the games that everyone expects to be big, that would help a bit as well.

I mean, I *worked* at a gaming magazine. We would feature the games that we thought most people were interested in, and in turn, our readers were even more interested in those few games we featured, because we were where they looked to see what new stuff was coming out. If we did not feature it, chances were, our readers would never hear of those titles. It's a self-perpetuating cycle that takes effort, strategy and luck to break into (like, if you release a ""small"" game in a month where not much else is going on, you get more coverage than you would otherwise get).

A particular case for this at the moment seems Anthem: There really isn't anything special about it from my perspective; It may turn out good, it may turn out bad, we don't know, but there's nothing about it *as a game* that warrants this level of interest. But it gets insane amounts of coverage simply because it's made by Bioware/EA, and that gets clicks. There would be a dozen titles that would be more interesting to feature if all we looked at were the games themselves.

Anywho, enough rambling: I think it's good to talk about titles and companies that treat their customers right; They deserve the mention and exposure, even if slagging the bad guys usually gets more clicks.",1547491727,1,1547488127.0,EA,0.9997701

I've been playing the game since it bit ea and quit shortly after Miramar dropped, and the game went ""live."" They don't care about hackers. They care about making low-effort changes to the game so they can keep the game relevant for longer. The Chinese business model for mobile games is to constantly appeal to new players and not bother to support the game in a truly meaningful way because retention is expensive and doesn't generate the same level of profit. Look up who owns the game. It will tell  you a whole lot. Retaining an eSports title occasionally requires doing something like this, but it's not a hard line at all. It's something that should have happened a long time ago, and is a token effort. There's tons of hacking in the game and they know it. The entire reason they won't region lock the game is because Chinese players won't spend money if all they're doing is playing other hackers in their region.

If they really wanted to fix the game, they'd fix it. At present, all the important shit is clientside and the netcode is an attrocious mess, just like it was at launch.

Not that I'd be displeased if Anthem were a good game with non-shitty monetization schemes and a well balanced, enjoyable gameplay loop, but I plain don't trust EA and pretending they have a bid at even attempting to overtake a F2P game that, despite it's few missteps, was made with a genuine passion from a small studio that didn't have the predisposition of being assholes in the name of jamming their fingers ass deep into everyone's ass-wallets as possible and the weaknesses commonly associated with that type of behavior, I'd say Warframe isn't going to see anything except a possible rise in playercount  should Anthem stumble out of the gate.

The decision to close down the studio was made before the sales hit even existed in the numbers.

They killed the studio because EA corporate had offered them up to 6 months delay to polish the game, and the studio had turned down that offer. The game as released was of poor quality, well below EA's standards, and part of that was a severe lack of polish - lots of bugs, and lots of *highly visible* bugs.

It would have still been disappointing for a lot of people, but it probably would have gotten an 80 instead of a 70 on metacritic and they would have been able to sell DLC for it.

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

Call of Duty makes money hand over fist but that wasn’t enough. They attempt to “be the good guy, look no loot boxes “ for black ops 4. A game without a campaign, a premium dlc pass, and microtransaction based progression for unlocks . They say you can unlock stuff by just playing, but it’s designed to be a sloggy grind to get the weapons near the end of the supply stream. So they fill the loot pool with trash , incentivizing skipping tiers. So obviously the game is going to under perform on the delivery, it’s not just about making money, it’s about making more money. And now the hammer is coming down on call of duty. So Bungie probably acted in a defensive claim to Activisions claim of Destiny under performing . Bungie May have had a clause stating that Activisions business practices harmed the final product and reception , making the full relinquishing of rights easier to claim. The whole thing is a gamble for Bungie but so far support wise I think they did the right thing for not just Destiny , but any game they make from here on out . Usually companies don’t leave the big boys with their limbs intact. They shut down as an empty husk. Thrown to the piles of Maxis, Westwood, Vicarious , Visceral etc. It’s becoming clear in the new AAA market that you do not need publishers as much as the market used to. Digital delivery is massive, corporate practices hurt game development and quality . Battlefield used to be a big series (still is ) but that brand is now being tarnished due to EA. Same with BioWares new game. The first thing people say now is they don’t trust BioWare because it’s being published by EA.

People are conflating a lot of issues here and I feel like they are dumping a disproportionate amount of hate on Epic and trying to paint it out like the developers aren't to blame when they take these deals.

&gt;They're being the bully to consumers. ""You want this game, well you have to get it from us because we paid the developers off.""

Ha, no. Coffee Stain said that. Not Epic. 

Over the years people have said leveled a lot of anti-consumer accusations at Valve. From their custom service, return policy, their attempt to monetize mods. They are hardly saints and while they may not have paid for an ""exclusive"", they have definitely thrown their weight around more than Epic has.

&gt;Take-Two hasn't yet, but I can't see it not happening.

&gt;Other than indies (though that's hit and miss with EPIC's $$$ flying around for exclusives), WB, THQ, Devolver, CD Projekt, etc. it's getting slim pickings on Steam from a AAA standpoint.

&gt;I hope everyone loves having 6-10 logins, friends lists, etc. because that's the land we're in now.

Ubisoft already mentioned it was select games, and EA, Activision only provide single IP's on steam. Bethesda as far as I know is going to be coming back, as the Beth.Net launcher was a absolute garbage pile and RAGE 2 is gonna sell less then 1000 copies on PC from how it's looking.

Ubisoft doesn't care they are testing the waters atm. Plus they have uPlay. Take-Two has Rockstar Social Club. Epic is only going for games people know. Or publishers being paid. That's all.

Yeah, same here - there's a lot of good practices around, they're just not found with the biggest companies. I think if we talked more about games that do stuff right instead of talking about the games that everyone expects to be big, that would help a bit as well.

I mean, I *worked* at a gaming magazine. We would feature the games that we thought most people were interested in, and in turn, our readers were even more interested in those few games we featured, because we were where they looked to see what new stuff was coming out. If we did not feature it, chances were, our readers would never hear of those titles. It's a self-perpetuating cycle that takes effort, strategy and luck to break into (like, if you release a ""small"" game in a month where not much else is going on, you get more coverage than you would otherwise get).

A particular case for this at the moment seems Anthem: There really isn't anything special about it from my perspective; It may turn out good, it may turn out bad, we don't know, but there's nothing about it *as a game* that warrants this level of interest. But it gets insane amounts of coverage simply because it's made by Bioware/EA, and that gets clicks. There would be a dozen titles that would be more interesting to feature if all we looked at were the games themselves.

https://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649

&gt;In 2009, EA executive Rich Hilleman indicated in a speech that his company ""now typically spends two or three times as much on marketing and advertising as it does on developing a game."" This formula is not necessarily applicable to every potential blockbuster game—a ""AAA game"", in gaming parlance—or to every company, but it is fair to say the break-even point for the average AAA game is well above the development budget. Companies also need to recoup marketing and other expenses.

suddenly it's easy to see how ""small"" personalities on blogs, youtube, Twitch, etc. can essentially live off of and thrive from ad revenue splits alone. Ubisoft is on of the companies throwing millions to get their name out there.

for ubisoft speficially, here's a ballpark in one country, 5 years ago:

2525,490,jabba_the_wutt,"&gt; I'd actually firmly place Bioware itself - they're not very good at characters

I mean obviously you are entitled to your opinion but the overwhelming majority of gamers and critics don't agree with you here.  Mass Effect, Dragon Age, even the old Baldur's Gate games have many of the most beloved characters in gaming.  I think characters are by far the best thing Bioware does.

&gt;In all of Mass Effect, Shephard's god status is never reflected in any unique mechanics

Shepard is not a god.  Shepard is a normal person who accomplished amazing things.  

It seems like gameplay and narrative working together seamlessly is really important to you.  I do understand that, and agree somewhat, depending on the game.  RDR2 is without a doubt one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had but my biggest issue with it was the horrible disconnect between the absurd gun battles with you mowing down dozens of goons, and the rest of the game which was hyper immersive and all fed into the narrative experience.

I find it interesting that you bring up The Witcher 3 thought, because that is another game where I felt the gameplay clashed with the narrative.  To me the best part of TW3 was the sheer quantity of high quality sidequests, many that had decisions that *felt* consequential as you say (although I would argue they actually were not consequential and the gameplay never substantially changed no matter what you did).

But doing those side quests makes absolutely no sense from the standpoint of the main narrative.  The open world design actually got in the way of the story the game was trying to tell.  It felt disjointed, doing a main story mission then fucking around for a few hours doing side stuff, coming back to the next main story quest and there was this weird gap in the timeline that was never acknowledged at all by the game.  This is a problem in a lot of open world games but it was worse in TW3 which the narrative was really the core of the entire experience.

Regardless though, I think you might have misunderstood me a bit because none of this really relates to Anthem, which is a completely different game that at its core is about the multiplayer action gameplay.  I'm not going into Anthem looking for a deep, choice/consequence narrative experience any more than I was going into RDR2 or TW3 expecting a super deep and satisfying combat system.  Nor am I going into it expecting great character development like Portal.  

When I was trying to say is it seems like by your own definition of ""generic,"" a game like the The Witcher 3 fits the bill.  There's nothing *new* about TW3.  It's just an extremely high quality game.  



&gt;Will that do, and will you agree that at the very least myself - and others expressing doubt about this game - might have very valid reasons for doing so, and are not being nefarious in nature but rather disappointed to not be excited? 

I'm not saying you can't express doubt about the game.  But I am saying you don't really seem to be giving it a fair chance.  Saying Anthem is identical to Destiny is simply not true, and indicates to me you've formed an opinion about this game prior to actually learning anything about it - something which I've noticed a lot of other people have done with this particular game as well, I assume because ""fuck EA"" or whatever.

I hate 2D platformers, I just don't like those kinds of games.  That doesn't mean I shit all over them, I don't know anything about them and don't care to.  I don't think they are bad games, they just aren't for me.  If you simply aren't interested in this genre of game because it doesn't emphasize narrative gameplay enough, that's fine.  But don't lob empty criticisms like it's ""generic"" without really explaining how, or it's ""identical to this other game"" when that's straight up false.",1547247283,1,1547243683.0,EA,0.0038520505

I've been playing the game since it bit ea and quit shortly after Miramar dropped, and the game went ""live."" They don't care about hackers. They care about making low-effort changes to the game so they can keep the game relevant for longer. The Chinese business model for mobile games is to constantly appeal to new players and not bother to support the game in a truly meaningful way because retention is expensive and doesn't generate the same level of profit. Look up who owns the game. It will tell  you a whole lot. Retaining an eSports title occasionally requires doing something like this, but it's not a hard line at all. It's something that should have happened a long time ago, and is a token effort. There's tons of hacking in the game and they know it. The entire reason they won't region lock the game is because Chinese players won't spend money if all they're doing is playing other hackers in their region.

If they really wanted to fix the game, they'd fix it. At present, all the important shit is clientside and the netcode is an attrocious mess, just like it was at launch.

They killed the studio because EA corporate had offered them up to 6 months delay to polish the game, and the studio had turned down that offer.

https://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649

&gt;In 2009, EA executive Rich Hilleman indicated in a speech that his company ""now typically spends two or three times as much on marketing and advertising as it does on developing a game."" This formula is not necessarily applicable to every potential blockbuster game—a ""AAA game"", in gaming parlance—or to every company, but it is fair to say the break-even point for the average AAA game is well above the development budget. Companies also need to recoup marketing and other expenses.

suddenly it's easy to see how ""small"" personalities on blogs, youtube, Twitch, etc. can essentially live off of and thrive from ad revenue splits alone. Ubisoft is on of the companies throwing millions to get their name out there.

for ubisoft speficially, here's a ballpark in one country, 5 years ago:

There are still fragments of this left if you play the ""coop only"" sections of the game, but this was originally supposed to be what the entire game was like. Additionally, the tone of the game was MUCH closer to the first two games, and was going to be MUCH scarier. They really wanted to replicate the feeling of insanity with the players themselves.

Sadly, the game came out in 2013, a couple years before horror games had shown that they could sell to a mass audience. This was also during the heyday of games like CoD and Battlefield, and every major publisher thought the goal was to make games more action-oriented.

This is a gross oversimplification that I see parroted all the time on Reddit. Investors are not a boogieman, and they do not as a general rule ask companies to sacrifice long-term profitability for short-term gains.

The real answer is that games as an industry is experiencing some turmoil. The broader stock market has been tanking lately, and the big three (ATVI, TTWO, EA) have all had major pullbacks in stock price. Games have been trending towards becoming more expensive than ever, which is putting pressure on margins. Meanwhile, you've got mobile developers like King (just an example) that are making insane profit margins on very cheaply-produced games. Lootboxes were an attempt to introduce this kind of monetization into the AAA sphere, and gamers balked at it after awhile. The grass is greener in the zero effort mobile industry right now.

As a business, something like Diablo Immortal can be cranked out in a year with reused assets and make insane bank even with the kind of backlash you've seen from Blizzard's western audiences. There is a goodwill cost associated with giving your core fans something different from what they've been asking for, though. Blizzard is slowly eroding the love of their fiercely loyal community, and that's a price that is hard for investors to analyze. 

It doesn't help that the work culture that produces these games is also facing several now public issues. Unhealthy work life balance leading to talks of unions, op/ed pieces from former employees talking about how inappropriate some aspects of office life were, etc. These are issues that can affect the quality or rate of release for games, and profitability in the long run.

2606,571,2woobi,"If you're wondering why Microsoft is pushing Game Pass, aggressively purchasing studios or gearing up xCloud, this is it. Microsoft has been late to the party in so many different spaces, like mobile, and simply missed out in capitalizing on those industries. Video games is one area they're endemic to and the prospect of Amazon and Google entering the fold has been one of the reasons I imagine that the Xbox division has been given somewhat of a blank check. I'm sure that targeting the hundreds of millions or billions of mobile users with xCloud (presumably tied to Game Pass) is another reason why Phil Spencer now has a seat at the table with Sataya Nadella in a time where Azure is a huge part of Microsoft's business.

So, why is Microsoft buying studios? I'd say one reason is to grab what they can before Amazon and Google decide they want to spend big on acquiring their own. Another more obvious reason is to beef up the offering of Game Pass similarly to how Netflix has transitioned to investing primarily in original content. There's a very feasible future where EA, Ubisoft or Activision decide to split from Xbox, partner up with a Google or Amazon for their cloud infrastructure, and leaving the Xbox platform with huge holes in its offering. We're probably a generation or two away form this happening, but it very likely will occur. That's why we'll probably see even more studios bought by Microsoft, almost half a dozen of which are rumored to be in the works at the moment anyways, and it hasn't even been a year since E3 (six studios have been acquired thus far, one created from scratch).

As for the viability of streaming, I think we're getting closer to that reality. Microsoft will seemingly release a streaming box or stick alongside their next Xbox console and have been doing work on the back-end to tackle the issue of latency in a time where people just have shitty internet speeds. I want to say that xCloud was stated to need 10 mb/s down, but don't quote on me on that. Microsoft is also looking into ways to offload some of the processing of a game on the device even for low end hardware while also leveraging AI to predict player input.

The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

2618,583,-jjjjjjjjjj-,"You say that, but its not true. Microtransaction games generate more money in a month than blockbuster AAA games do in a year. It takes a team at least a year and 10's of millions to develop a single AAA game. Even if they do everything right and have loyal customers, that's (at most) one purchase per customer per year per development team. Microtransactions allow you to reap dozens or hundreds of purchases per year from a subset of your customers. 

These companies don't really give a shit if their loyal customers (who will only pay once a year) abandon them as long as they are getting whales to play their microtransaction games. The issue is, they aren't getting that. Whales generally only play one game at a time (or at most one in a particular genre) because they are addictive personalities. Fortnite is unquestionably the leader in the FPS space and so that's where most of the whales are. Its also popular with teens and young kids who also have very poor impulse control (if shallower pockets).

So companies like Activision and EA who sink hundreds of millions in developing their FPS franchises are hurting because they are losing whales and kids to Fortnite. This is why you see such a strong pullback from these companies in their conventional strategy and RPG games (which are even less profitable than FPS games) and a refocusing toward mobile games. If Activision can't make enough profit from CoD because of Fortnite, they'll just go after the Asian market, which loves mobile games.",1547157673,1,1547154073.0,EA,0.023979802

I've been playing the game since it bit ea and quit shortly after Miramar dropped, and the game went ""live."" They don't care about hackers. They care about making low-effort changes to the game so they can keep the game relevant for longer. The Chinese business model for mobile games is to constantly appeal to new players and not bother to support the game in a truly meaningful way because retention is expensive and doesn't generate the same level of profit. Look up who owns the game. It will tell  you a whole lot. Retaining an eSports title occasionally requires doing something like this, but it's not a hard line at all. It's something that should have happened a long time ago, and is a token effort. There's tons of hacking in the game and they know it. The entire reason they won't region lock the game is because Chinese players won't spend money if all they're doing is playing other hackers in their region.

If they really wanted to fix the game, they'd fix it. At present, all the important shit is clientside and the netcode is an attrocious mess, just like it was at launch.

https://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649

&gt;In 2009, EA executive Rich Hilleman indicated in a speech that his company ""now typically spends two or three times as much on marketing and advertising as it does on developing a game."" This formula is not necessarily applicable to every potential blockbuster game—a ""AAA game"", in gaming parlance—or to every company, but it is fair to say the break-even point for the average AAA game is well above the development budget. Companies also need to recoup marketing and other expenses.

suddenly it's easy to see how ""small"" personalities on blogs, youtube, Twitch, etc. can essentially live off of and thrive from ad revenue splits alone. Ubisoft is on of the companies throwing millions to get their name out there.

for ubisoft speficially, here's a ballpark in one country, 5 years ago:

&gt;When he (the customer) pointed out that the ticket was created before the time limit was up, the rep told him that the policy means 24 hours from purchase.

TLDR: The customer purchased the game and after playing it wanted a refund. The policy (see above) says that the refund request can be made ""within 24 hours after you first launch the game"", which the customer did in this case. However, EA is refusing to refund it stating that the policy means 24 hours from purchase. The customer still has not received their refund after 3 days.

There are still fragments of this left if you play the ""coop only"" sections of the game, but this was originally supposed to be what the entire game was like. Additionally, the tone of the game was MUCH closer to the first two games, and was going to be MUCH scarier. They really wanted to replicate the feeling of insanity with the players themselves.

Sadly, the game came out in 2013, a couple years before horror games had shown that they could sell to a mass audience. This was also during the heyday of games like CoD and Battlefield, and every major publisher thought the goal was to make games more action-oriented.  Resident Evil games, up to this point, were following the same trend. That being said, I can sort of understand why EA wouldn't have too much faith in a coop-only game.

Steam also demands that the DLC gets sold through them. Again, devs and publishers do not like that (I believe that's actually one of the main reasons why EA isn't on Steam anymore). Afaik, Epic (or anyone else) has no such requirements.

This is a gross oversimplification that I see parroted all the time on Reddit. Investors are not a boogieman, and they do not as a general rule ask companies to sacrifice long-term profitability for short-term gains.

The real answer is that games as an industry is experiencing some turmoil. The broader stock market has been tanking lately, and the big three (ATVI, TTWO, EA) have all had major pullbacks in stock price. Games have been trending towards becoming more expensive than ever, which is putting pressure on margins. Meanwhile, you've got mobile developers like King (just an example) that are making insane profit margins on very cheaply-produced games. Lootboxes were an attempt to introduce this kind of monetization into the AAA sphere, and gamers balked at it after awhile. The grass is greener in the zero effort mobile industry right now.

As a business, something like Diablo Immortal can be cranked out in a year with reused assets and make insane bank even with the kind of backlash you've seen from Blizzard's western audiences. There is a goodwill cost associated with giving your core fans something different from what they've been asking for, though. Blizzard is slowly eroding the love of their fiercely loyal community, and that's a price that is hard for investors to analyze. 

It doesn't help that the work culture that produces these games is also facing several now public issues. Unhealthy work life balance leading to talks of unions, op/ed pieces from former employees talking about how inappropriate some aspects of office life were, etc. These are issues that can affect the quality or rate of release for games, and profitability in the long run.

When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2.

I've been playing the game since it bit ea and quit shortly after Miramar dropped, and the game went ""live."" They don't care about hackers. They care about making low-effort changes to the game so they can keep the game relevant for longer. The Chinese business model for mobile games is to constantly appeal to new players and not bother to support the game in a truly meaningful way because retention is expensive and doesn't generate the same level of profit. Look up who owns the game. It will tell  you a whole lot. Retaining an eSports title occasionally requires doing something like this, but it's not a hard line at all. It's something that should have happened a long time ago, and is a token effort. There's tons of hacking in the game and they know it. The entire reason they won't region lock the game is because Chinese players won't spend money if all they're doing is playing other hackers in their region.

If they really wanted to fix the game, they'd fix it. At present, all the important shit is clientside and the netcode is an attrocious mess, just like it was at launch.

The decision to close down the studio was made before the sales hit even existed in the numbers.

They killed the studio because EA corporate had offered them up to 6 months delay to polish the game, and the studio had turned down that offer.

&gt;In 2009, EA executive Rich Hilleman indicated in a speech that his company ""now typically spends two or three times as much on marketing and advertising as it does on developing a game."" This formula is not necessarily applicable to every potential blockbuster game—a ""AAA game"", in gaming parlance—or to every company, but it is fair to say the break-even point for the average AAA game is well above the development budget. Companies also need to recoup marketing and other expenses.

suddenly it's easy to see how ""small"" personalities on blogs, youtube, Twitch, etc. can essentially live off of and thrive from ad revenue splits alone. Ubisoft is on of the companies throwing millions to get their name out there.

Sadly, the game came out in 2013, a couple years before horror games had shown that they could sell to a mass audience.

This is a gross oversimplification that I see parroted all the time on Reddit. Investors are not a boogieman, and they do not as a general rule ask companies to sacrifice long-term profitability for short-term gains.

The real answer is that games as an industry is experiencing some turmoil. The broader stock market has been tanking lately, and the big three (ATVI, TTWO, EA) have all had major pullbacks in stock price. Games have been trending towards becoming more expensive than ever, which is putting pressure on margins. Meanwhile, you've got mobile developers like King (just an example) that are making insane profit margins on very cheaply-produced games. Lootboxes were an attempt to introduce this kind of monetization into the AAA sphere, and gamers balked at it after awhile. The grass is greener in the zero effort mobile industry right now.

As a business, something like Diablo Immortal can be cranked out in a year with reused assets and make insane bank even with the kind of backlash you've seen from Blizzard's western audiences. There is a goodwill cost associated with giving your core fans something different from what they've been asking for, though. Blizzard is slowly eroding the love of their fiercely loyal community, and that's a price that is hard for investors to analyze. 

It doesn't help that the work culture that produces these games is also facing several now public issues. Unhealthy work life balance leading to talks of unions, op/ed pieces from former employees talking about how inappropriate some aspects of office life were, etc. These are issues that can affect the quality or rate of release for games, and profitability in the long run.

The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

The decision to close down the studio was made before the sales hit even existed in the numbers.

They killed the studio because EA corporate had offered them up to 6 months delay to polish the game, and the studio had turned down that offer. The game as released was of poor quality, well below EA's standards, and part of that was a severe lack of polish - lots of bugs, and lots of *highly visible* bugs.

It would have still been disappointing for a lot of people, but it probably would have gotten an 80 instead of a 70 on metacritic and they would have been able to sell DLC for it.

2818,1,Divolinon,"""After further discussions with the Belgian authorities, we decided not to offer FIFA points for sale in Belgium anymore,"" said Electronic Arts, the developer of the FIFA games, in a communication. These points can be used to buy packages with players, although you don't know what you'll get. ""That's gambling,"" says the Belgian gambling commission.
These FIFA points can be used to purchase so-called 'ultimate team packages' in the game. These are digital surprise packages or loot boxes with well-known players. On the EA site you can even find the probability per category of player. The better the player, the smaller the chance.

EA always shroudedly called it 'a way of playing' or 'pin dynamics', but since you can not only win FIFA points, but can also buy them with real money, that's clearly 'gambling', according to the Belgian gambling commission. EA says it is ""disappointed"". ""Although we are taking this step, we don't agree with the Belgian authorities' interpretation of the law and we're still looking for more clarity on this"", it sounds in a communication. ""The impact of this change on FIFA Ultimate Team in Belgium has no material impact on our financial performance.

The creator of the game alludes that the revenues from these surprise packages are small. A small survey among advanced players shows that 'bought team' with such packages can quickly cost 5,000 euros.

Figures show that EA generates about 67 percent of all revenues, about 3 billion euros, from digital sales. According to business magazine Forbes, the share of 'surprise packages' in this is crucial.

Anyone who in the past 'won' or 'bought' players in this way may keep it that way. ""Players still have access to the Ultimate Team game mode and can continue playing with their current players. All content of the game can, as has always been the case, be won by playing the game and players can continue to use coins and the transfer market.

Maybe don't charge an arm and a leg just to attend a football match? The whole argument around videogames getting in the way is completely ridiculous, especially when you look at the timeframe. It's also quite the contradictory statement to complain about kids not having the attention span to watch football but then blaming video games which include football games like PES and FIFA? It costs so much to go to a football match and especially for the big boys like Chelsea and Liverpool, the cost of transport, tickets and all the rest doesn't justify the means. Especially if you get a rubbish seat or have to sit through a dull 0-0.

Between 3pm and 5pm is when a typical game is played and in the UK there's a HUGE culture around football that stretches all the way to the youngsters. Many kids (including my own) have a healthy balance between playing sports and playing video games. It shows a complete disengagement with youngsters to suggest none of them are into football because quite the opposite is true - they just don't go to the matches due to financial pressure from struggling families.

2829,12,Dynamite_Shovels,"Agree. And it's a bit more insidious with Fifa - not only is there a grind that can only be broken with packs of players with random drops (the best players obviously having an insanely small chance of dropping), some of the most popular videos of the game on YouTube are pack openings. Not playing the game, just dropping money on the game and opening packs. EA encourage youtubers and other 'influencers' by partnering with them, in turn churning out more pack opening videos, which encourage their fans to do the same. 

There are also rumours (possibly well founded) that some of the more popular EA YouTube partners get increased odds on these packs to get their viewers believing there's a chance of getting the best players in it. I think this came about because the most popular fifa YouTuber (Chuboy or some shit) got three Icon players in a week, whilst wearing EA branded clothes. Not sure if you play fifa or not, but Icons are outrageously rare drops with probably a less than half a percent chance of dropping in a pack, if that. To get 3 in a week is just ridiculous.

Many consider Pro Evo to have better gameplay than Fifa, but the lack of licences (although you can edit them in yourself) is a deal breaker for a lot of people.

2852,35,Chrop,"Depends on the loot box.

The problem with FIFA is that you gain gameplay value, the better cards you have, the stronger your team becomes. The value of a player and rarity of the card is determined by the company.

The company can then set up a market for players to buy and trade their cards, which EA take a 5% cut from. EA profit from people buying cards AND selling them. 

For someone to buy a card, they have to add funds into the game, then buy it. 

Ultimately, this means you spend actual money to buy packs of cards, then can sell it for in game money, which can be used to buy more cards. EA make a profit from people buying and selling cards. They can then nudge the market price of a card by the rarity and power of the card. 

Take this into the real world. You don’t buy TCG cards for the possibility of selling it to someone later, companies of these TCG don’t make a profit from players trading their cards, meaning you aren’t spending money to make more money, you can, but that isn’t the purpose of the cards.

With physical trading cards, you spend money to gain a random toy back, that’s what you gain. The customers themselves set up the market and buy/trade with each other, the companies have no impact on this and do not profit from this. 

If you want, you can buy all your TCG cards though other players, you can have an entire deck and not give the company a single penny for it. The fact you can sell it for a profit is out of the companies control, that’s just how TCG work.

And if you’re willing to claim any random chance item are gambling, then you can claim Kinder Eggs are gambling. Which we know is insane.",1548765138,14,1548761538.0,Fifa,0.017569829

Did you even read the article you yourself posted? PC digital sales were not counted, not digital sales as a whole. As it stands the game is behind several console exclusive releases where digital sales are counted on both ends, with physical sales added on PC as a bonus. On top of that it's a mere two spots ahead of Call of Duty: WWII which also didn't have its PC digital sales counted and behind FIFA (also had no digital PC sales counted) which has a consistently weak showing in the US compared to other regions. It's also not in the top 10 games worldwide by [revenue](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/64534/top-10-premium-games-2018-revenue/index.html), further indicating a poor reception. And lastly, Battlefield 1 was on second place in its release year despite also not counting digital PC sales, so unless the market drastically changed since then we have a fairly solid benchmark here to showcase what a game that actually sells really well with those restrictions should look like.

Ultimately, there is no real evidence to indicate that digital sales on PC are somehow enough to make a convincing argument that the game didn't sell poorly.

One good reason they would target adults over children? When an adult impulse buys something it's a one step transaction. Hit the buy button, money comes out of the account. With kids they need to go through mommy or daddy to get that money. If EA specifically targeted kids they'd need a way to convince parents that the spending their kids are doing in the game is fine. As-is, EA can target everybody and get some income from children in the crossfire. Their main moneymakers with FIFA are adults, not kids. The amount of guys in their mid twenties pouring money into FIFA is astronomical. EA wants the adults who can grab their credit card and spend away without a second thought first and foremost, if they can convince some kids to beg their parents for a 10 dollar pack at the same time, that's a bonus, but that isn't the demographic they are targeting specifically.",1548778865,2,1548775265.0,Fifa,0.004980939

These points can be used to buy packages with players, although you don't know what you'll get. ""That's gambling,"" says the Belgian gambling commission.
These FIFA points can be used to purchase so-called 'ultimate team packages' in the game. These are digital surprise packages or loot boxes with well-known players. On the EA site you can even find the probability per category of player. The better the player, the smaller the chance.

EA always shroudedly called it 'a way of playing' or 'pin dynamics', but since you can not only win FIFA points, but can also buy them with real money, that's clearly 'gambling', according to the Belgian gambling commission. EA says it is ""disappointed"". ""Although we are taking this step, we don't agree with the Belgian authorities' interpretation of the law and we're still looking for more clarity on this"", it sounds in a communication. ""The impact of this change on FIFA Ultimate Team in Belgium has no material impact on our financial performance.

The creator of the game alludes that the revenues from these surprise packages are small. A small survey among advanced players shows that 'bought team' with such packages can quickly cost 5,000 euros.

Figures show that EA generates about 67 percent of all revenues, about 3 billion euros, from digital sales. According to business magazine Forbes, the share of 'surprise packages' in this is crucial.

Anyone who in the past 'won' or 'bought' players in this way may keep it that way. ""Players still have access to the Ultimate Team game mode and can continue playing with their current players. All content of the game can, as has always been the case, be won by playing the game and players can continue to use coins and the transfer market.

Maybe don't charge an arm and a leg just to attend a football match? The whole argument around videogames getting in the way is completely ridiculous, especially when you look at the timeframe. It's also quite the contradictory statement to complain about kids not having the attention span to watch football but then blaming video games which include football games like PES and FIFA? It costs so much to go to a football match and especially for the big boys like Chelsea and Liverpool, the cost of transport, tickets and all the rest doesn't justify the means. Especially if you get a rubbish seat or have to sit through a dull 0-0.

Between 3pm and 5pm is when a typical game is played and in the UK there's a HUGE culture around football that stretches all the way to the youngsters. Many kids (including my own) have a healthy balance between playing sports and playing video games. It shows a complete disengagement with youngsters to suggest none of them are into football because quite the opposite is true - they just don't go to the matches due to financial pressure from struggling families.

Besides, Sky Sports is so overpriced if anyone REALLY wanted to watch a game they'd just stream it online for free and encourage their kids to do the same.

2927,110,Dynamite_Shovels,"Agree. And it's a bit more insidious with Fifa - not only is there a grind that can only be broken with packs of players with random drops (the best players obviously having an insanely small chance of dropping), some of the most popular videos of the game on YouTube are pack openings. Not playing the game, just dropping money on the game and opening packs. EA encourage youtubers and other 'influencers' by partnering with them, in turn churning out more pack opening videos, which encourage their fans to do the same. 

There are also rumours (possibly well founded) that some of the more popular EA YouTube partners get increased odds on these packs to get their viewers believing there's a chance of getting the best players in it. I think this came about because the most popular fifa YouTuber (Chuboy or some shit) got three Icon players in a week, whilst wearing EA branded clothes. Not sure if you play fifa or not, but Icons are outrageously rare drops with probably a less than half a percent chance of dropping in a pack, if that. To get 3 in a week is just ridiculous.

Many consider Pro Evo to have better gameplay than Fifa, but the lack of licences (although you can edit them in yourself) is a deal breaker for a lot of people.

2947,130,Chrop,"Depends on the loot box.

The problem with FIFA is that you gain gameplay value, the better cards you have, the stronger your team becomes. The value of a player and rarity of the card is determined by the company.

The company can then set up a market for players to buy and trade their cards, which EA take a 5% cut from. EA profit from people buying cards AND selling them. 

For someone to buy a card, they have to add funds into the game, then buy it. 

Ultimately, this means you spend actual money to buy packs of cards, then can sell it for in game money, which can be used to buy more cards. EA make a profit from people buying and selling cards. They can then nudge the market price of a card by the rarity and power of the card. 

Take this into the real world. You don’t buy TCG cards for the possibility of selling it to someone later, companies of these TCG don’t make a profit from players trading their cards, meaning you aren’t spending money to make more money, you can, but that isn’t the purpose of the cards.

With physical trading cards, you spend money to gain a random toy back, that’s what you gain. The customers themselves set up the market and buy/trade with each other, the companies have no impact on this and do not profit from this. 

If you want, you can buy all your TCG cards though other players, you can have an entire deck and not give the company a single penny for it. The fact you can sell it for a profit is out of the companies control, that’s just how TCG work.

And if you’re willing to claim any random chance item are gambling, then you can claim Kinder Eggs are gambling. Which we know is insane.",1548765138,14,1548761538.0,Fifa,0.017569829

2957,140,iTomes,"&gt; Did you even read a single article regarding this ranking? For BFV digital sales were not counted.

Did you even read the article you yourself posted? PC digital sales were not counted, not digital sales as a whole. As it stands the game is behind several console exclusive releases where digital sales are counted on both ends, with physical sales added on PC as a bonus. On top of that it's a mere two spots ahead of Call of Duty: WWII which also didn't have its PC digital sales counted and behind FIFA (also had no digital PC sales counted) which has a consistently weak showing in the US compared to other regions. It's also not in the top 10 games worldwide by [revenue](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/64534/top-10-premium-games-2018-revenue/index.html), further indicating a poor reception. And lastly, Battlefield 1 was on second place in its release year despite also not counting digital PC sales, so unless the market drastically changed since then we have a fairly solid benchmark here to showcase what a game that actually sells really well with those restrictions should look like.

Ultimately, there is no real evidence to indicate that digital sales on PC are somehow enough to make a convincing argument that the game didn't sell poorly.

You don't seem to be willing to do that and are clearly emotionally attached to the argument and think it's about what you would like the definition to be instead of trying to figure out what it actually could be seen as without allegiances to gaming companies or the legislators of Belgium. I don't see the point in cheering for EA or Belgium like this was a sports match, I was trying to have an actual conversation about the concept of gambling, so I'm out.

Nobody is forcing Metro to be an EPIC store exclusive, they signed themselves up willingly. The Developers under EA though don't get a choice because they are owned by the dick to the neck with the EA collar.

EA is also happy to completely kill dev teams for not selling enough copies or not meeting a score on Metacritic.  Companies selling their own games exlusively is fine, and it's what Nintendo does for instant:  What isn't OK is buying exclusivity rights to third party IPs so you can exclusively sell them, that's anti-consumer.

Yup. And the big problem with FUT specifically is that FIFA is the only officially-licensed football game. If you want the real players (or in some cases real teams, even), who the kids idolize, you have to get FIFA. There's no alternative game, there's just telling your kid he can't have a football that his mates have and play with each other and so on. Which is pretty awful (and partly FIFA's fault, I note).

So when EA decided to make FUT a bigger and bigger part of the game, to focus more and more on it, that was really problematic, because they know perfectly well that half their players are kids, and the ones most emotionally affected by and drawn to the card packs are kids, so it's pretty messed up.

They also piggybacked off a much less messed-up collecting phenomenon - when we were kids in the UK and Europe (people who dad-ages now) we used to have stickerbooks and buy packs of stickers which had random players in. This wasn't very addictive because honestly it wasn't very fun and didn't mean a whole lot. You didn't get to use the player or anything, he was just stuck in your stickerbook, so you were like ""Huh, that's it?"". That's why FUT uses the language of card packs and so on, to make parents thing ""Oh it's just like stickers when I was a kid!"". But it isn't. Not only is it a lot pricier, but it's a lot more obsession-building, and makes kids a lot more upset.",1547559730,1,1547556130.0,Fifa,0.0004255593

Finding more information about Europe seems kind of tricky: from what i'm reading, most of Europe only started collecting numbers for dematerialised gaming (including mobile) in 2018 and everyone is focused on Asia and NA. Plus each country has its own specificity and language, which, coupled with the fact that EMEA only represents roughly 10% of mobile spending as opposed to 25 for NA and 55 for APAC, makes Europe an unattractive market for investors, I guess.

3096,279,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Fifa,0.04236541

Why do you have to ""wait"" for it? Would you have rather they never added anything to the game? Would that make them less 'scummy'?

3099,282,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. If the Division doesn't sell then Valve doesn't need to do anything sine Ubisoft will come back by themselves.",1547103024,1,1547099424.0,Fifa,0.057639983

Especially if a company like Nintendo has a specific development team focused on that - I know they will still be making AAA quality titles. However, like I've said a million times already - if you only put out garbage like Battlefront and sell it as a AAA title it's trash. What else is EA making thats actual quality? If  it weren't for madden and Fifa (glorified roster updates)  EA would be finished. Bethesda has also been using the same engine for over a decade and as a result turned to micros and produced one of the worst games ever made. So again. There is a right way to do it and a wrong one. If Nintendo were to stop producing quality games at the pace they do due to the increased focus on micro driven games then I'd lump them into this horrible category too. But that is yet to be seen. Also, I don't consider Overwatch, Fortnite or League AAA titles. You simply do the same game mode thing over and over again. To me they're just unique games.

It rewards and demands the same strategies that I learned playing actual soccer and hockey growing up, which FIFA does not.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem.

Yes people who spend to much money on loot boxes are bad with money. You know who else has impulse control issues? Addicts.

Loot boxes are a different breed from magic and kinder, there are way more psychological tricks at play here. 

Why do you think companies give you the occasional free loot box? because they know if you open one you might want to open another! How about Activision patenting the matchmaking system that pits you against higher skilled players who have bought microtransactions to entice you to spend more money? What about Battlefields lootboxes that open in front of other players to show everyone what they are missing?

AC is another weird example of that, considering sales were dropping just like reviews and general opinion on the series was, so Ubisoft took time off and came up with Origins and now Odyssey which are quite different from the past games, down to core gameplay and all that.

Yup. And the big problem with FUT specifically is that FIFA is the only officially-licensed football game. If you want the real players (or in some cases real teams, even), who the kids idolize, you have to get FIFA. There's no alternative game, there's just telling your kid he can't have a football that his mates have and play with each other and so on. Which is pretty awful (and partly FIFA's fault, I note).

So when EA decided to make FUT a bigger and bigger part of the game, to focus more and more on it, that was really problematic, because they know perfectly well that half their players are kids, and the ones most emotionally affected by and drawn to the card packs are kids, so it's pretty messed up.

They also piggybacked off a much less messed-up collecting phenomenon - when we were kids in the UK and Europe (people who dad-ages now) we used to have stickerbooks and buy packs of stickers which had random players in. This wasn't very addictive because honestly it wasn't very fun and didn't mean a whole lot. You didn't get to use the player or anything, he was just stuck in your stickerbook, so you were like ""Huh, that's it?"". That's why FUT uses the language of card packs and so on, to make parents thing ""Oh it's just like stickers when I was a kid!"". But it isn't. Not only is it a lot pricier, but it's a lot more obsession-building, and makes kids a lot more upset.",1547559730,1,1547556130.0,Fifa,0.0004255593

Look at Fifa. The game sells every damn year for 60€, it makes a shit ton of money by that alone. Yet the amount the make due to it's microtransactions dwarfs that.

3158,341,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Fifa,0.04236541

Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. If the Division doesn't sell then Valve doesn't need to do anything sine Ubisoft will come back by themselves.",1547103024,1,1547099424.0,Fifa,0.057639983

I don't agree with your optimism on how big RL is going to be, but I do know what you're talking about here and absolutely agree.  Rocket League unironically reminds me more of actual soccer than FIFA does.  It rewards and demands the same strategies that I learned playing actual soccer and hockey growing up, which FIFA does not.  It also provides an environment where the ceiling for creativity and new techniques seems as high as it does for real sports.  Being physics-driven as opposed to scripted AI-driven like FIFA also makes the permutations of results feel way more natural and sport-like.  It's the most satisfying game I've played in years...

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem.

AC is another weird example of that, considering sales were dropping just like reviews and general opinion on the series was, so Ubisoft took time off and came up with Origins and now Odyssey which are quite different from the past games, down to core gameplay and all that.

Yup. And the big problem with FUT specifically is that FIFA is the only officially-licensed football game. If you want the real players (or in some cases real teams, even), who the kids idolize, you have to get FIFA. There's no alternative game, there's just telling your kid he can't have a football that his mates have and play with each other and so on. Which is pretty awful (and partly FIFA's fault, I note).

So when EA decided to make FUT a bigger and bigger part of the game, to focus more and more on it, that was really problematic, because they know perfectly well that half their players are kids, and the ones most emotionally affected by and drawn to the card packs are kids, so it's pretty messed up.

They also piggybacked off a much less messed-up collecting phenomenon - when we were kids in the UK and Europe (people who dad-ages now) we used to have stickerbooks and buy packs of stickers which had random players in. This wasn't very addictive because honestly it wasn't very fun and didn't mean a whole lot. You didn't get to use the player or anything, he was just stuck in your stickerbook, so you were like ""Huh, that's it?"". That's why FUT uses the language of card packs and so on, to make parents thing ""Oh it's just like stickers when I was a kid!"". But it isn't. Not only is it a lot pricier, but it's a lot more obsession-building, and makes kids a lot more upset.",1547559730,1,1547556130.0,Fifa,0.0004255593

FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Fifa,0.04236541

3207,390,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

I don't agree with your optimism on how big RL is going to be, but I do know what you're talking about here and absolutely agree.  Rocket League unironically reminds me more of actual soccer than FIFA does.  It rewards and demands the same strategies that I learned playing actual soccer and hockey growing up, which FIFA does not.  It also provides an environment where the ceiling for creativity and new techniques seems as high as it does for real sports.  Being physics-driven as opposed to scripted AI-driven like FIFA also makes the permutations of results feel way more natural and sport-like.  It's the most satisfying game I've played in years...

...or at least it would be if the community wasn't awful.  I've played since 2015 and players have just become more bitter and resentful towards their own teammates over that time.

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem.

So why not make the game FREE and charge for each different game mode (which in the end could be the full $60 price) This way FIFA would have way more copies out and us as consumers could end up paying less than the original $60 if we don’t play every single game mode.

Yup. And the big problem with FUT specifically is that FIFA is the only officially-licensed football game. If you want the real players (or in some cases real teams, even), who the kids idolize, you have to get FIFA. There's no alternative game, there's just telling your kid he can't have a football that his mates have and play with each other and so on. Which is pretty awful (and partly FIFA's fault, I note).

So when EA decided to make FUT a bigger and bigger part of the game, to focus more and more on it, that was really problematic, because they know perfectly well that half their players are kids, and the ones most emotionally affected by and drawn to the card packs are kids, so it's pretty messed up.

They also piggybacked off a much less messed-up collecting phenomenon - when we were kids in the UK and Europe (people who dad-ages now) we used to have stickerbooks and buy packs of stickers which had random players in. This wasn't very addictive because honestly it wasn't very fun and didn't mean a whole lot. You didn't get to use the player or anything, he was just stuck in your stickerbook, so you were like ""Huh, that's it?"". That's why FUT uses the language of card packs and so on, to make parents thing ""Oh it's just like stickers when I was a kid!"". But it isn't. Not only is it a lot pricier, but it's a lot more obsession-building, and makes kids a lot more upset.",1547559730,1,1547556130.0,Fifa,0.0004255593

Plus each country has its own specificity and language, which, coupled with the fact that EMEA only represents roughly 10% of mobile spending as opposed to 25 for NA and 55 for APAC, makes Europe an unattractive market for investors, I guess.

3248,431,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Fifa,0.04236541

The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

I don't agree with your optimism on how big RL is going to be, but I do know what you're talking about here and absolutely agree.

Yup. And the big problem with FUT specifically is that FIFA is the only officially-licensed football game. If you want the real players (or in some cases real teams, even), who the kids idolize, you have to get FIFA. There's no alternative game, there's just telling your kid he can't have a football that his mates have and play with each other and so on. Which is pretty awful (and partly FIFA's fault, I note).

So when EA decided to make FUT a bigger and bigger part of the game, to focus more and more on it, that was really problematic, because they know perfectly well that half their players are kids, and the ones most emotionally affected by and drawn to the card packs are kids, so it's pretty messed up.

They also piggybacked off a much less messed-up collecting phenomenon - when we were kids in the UK and Europe (people who dad-ages now) we used to have stickerbooks and buy packs of stickers which had random players in. This wasn't very addictive because honestly it wasn't very fun and didn't mean a whole lot. You didn't get to use the player or anything, he was just stuck in your stickerbook, so you were like ""Huh, that's it?"". That's why FUT uses the language of card packs and so on, to make parents thing ""Oh it's just like stickers when I was a kid!"". But it isn't. Not only is it a lot pricier, but it's a lot more obsession-building, and makes kids a lot more upset.",1547559730,1,1547556130.0,Fifa,0.0004255593

3287,470,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Fifa,0.04236541

3290,473,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. If the Division doesn't sell then Valve doesn't need to do anything sine Ubisoft will come back by themselves.",1547103024,1,1547099424.0,Fifa,0.057639983

3297,5,team56th,"We need to talk about **Anthem**.

So far the impression I've got from people around me is that they are hesitant to say they like it. There are various and obvious reasons behind this: being an unpopular hot take is one, demo's contents are limited, we still don't know how the endgame and post-launch support will turn out, etc.

But even then the pattern goes like this: They say one or two things they don't like, and then go on to explain what they did with the game, what they plan to do in the next round or next week, etc. The game is doing something right.

What is it?

* The overall structure of the combat is closest to Doom (2016). Doom makes an arena and then encourages you to play aggressive so that you can retrieve health and ammo. Because only the shield will auto-recover and some of the best weapons will always be in need of ammo, you have to keep killing to refill things. This is exactly how Anthem plays out. For better or worse it's very much a wave-based arena shooter and the goal is to clear out the horde of enemies in the most effective possible way.

* This will not work if the combat is bland. Here the keyword is **flexibility**. Anthem combines the combat style of *all* of the recent Bioware games; you often get the callbacks to rogues and mages in Dragon Age, Vanguard in Mass Effect, etc. And all of these styles work while being widely different from each other. The guns themselves may come off as weak as was the case in Mass Effect games, but the combination of all other abilities and gadgets makes it very engaging, especially when your party is comprised of different classes and styles.

* After the first mission I immediately realized why Bioware went with this mission for the demo. I was initially not sold on the ""our world, your story"" initiative, but if the demo is any indication, Bioware seems to have some ideas to make it fun. &gt;!The 3 confused Dominion enemies in the combat leading to the cloned Matthias with 3 different persona in the story hub was a nice touch IMO, not to mention the subtle jokes about how to call Matthias...es after the incident.!&lt; It all feels playful while not going for entirely in-your-face jokes. I have high hopes that the storytelling will be way better than existing options.

* A friend told me after the alpha test that the map *feels* big. Now I know why. The planar size may not be that big, but due to  how vertical and detailed it is, it was very difficult to fully digest what the world looks like. So on one hand I would definitely like a custom waypoint system, since it's rather easy to get lost. But overall it's a great design.

* Jetpack does not play like I expected. I think everybody would agree on this one. It does not feel like controlling a *character*, but rather a *machine*, sort of like how you control fighters in arcade flight sims. Once you accept this however, it feels special. It's weighty while feeling precise enough at the same time. But it definitely wouldn't translate well to KB/M, which IMO is the reason why people hate KB/M control on PC. Not sure if it will ever get solved.

Overall, an unmistakably Bioware game while being system-based rather than narrative-based. After ditching D&amp;D rules Bioware has long struggled to make a system of its own, which was rather successful with Mass Effect while not so with Dragon Age. Anthem goes full systems-based using Mass Effect 3 as a foundation, and it feels good.

3302,10,camycamera,"I finally put down **Dragon Age: Origins** after about 100 hours, having finished the Awakening and Witch Hunt DLC, didn't bother with the other DLCs, as to be honest, I was ready to put the game down in favour of another one (although that alternate ending DLC is extremely interesting as a concept, never heard of any other sort of DLC done like that!). 

The samey levels and encounters were starting to creep up on me too. But still, DA:O's/Witch Hunt's endings left me vaguely intrigued to have a go at DA2 and especially Inquisition (also because of the graphical and animation improvements for the latter). 

Awakening was a pretty good, albeit kinda short, *really* buggy (like the base game) with an abrupt ending, and the lack of the majority of the main game companions was disappointing. You see the mage Wynne once but never again, and you can't even ask her how Shale (best Golemn companion ever) was going these days. The new companions were really great, but man, nothing beats Alistar and Morrigan's banter. But overall, DA:O is an interesting beast though. Wish it had more of a budget like Mass Effect did, though.

**Prey: Mooncrash** is the game I was looking forward to playing after DA:O, and boy.... I'm about 10 hours into it, and it might just be better than the main game, and I *loved* the main game! Having characters as classes is a GENIUS idea, as, unlike the base game where how you get around and do things mostly just depends on what tree you were interested in going down (and I bet most went down the typhon route, as it has the coolest and OP abilities in the game), with classes, you have to get familiar with ALL of what the game has to offer. 

How you engage things like combat is going to be vastly different for each. For example, the soldier is at his best getting up close and personal with his shotgun, able to tank damage and deal loads of it, and be extremely manoeuvrable thanks to higher stamina/athletics, and abilities like slow-mo. Meanwhile, the director is probably at her best hiding as a mug while her typhon does the hard work.

And even better, what you do is persistent, so who you decide to go through first can be helpful later, like fixing a door as the engineer for the soldier to go through later. You can summon a bot to store items between characters too for convenience.

There's no manual save, so you have to live with your mistakes which works fantastic with immersive sims, and if you die, you die, but since there is always progress even in death. The timer, which brings in harder enemies as the game goes on until time runs out and you have to reset, puts you on your toes and to be efficient and not to turtle like the little bitch you probably were in the original game, but isn't so fast as to discourage exploration and soaking in the atmosphere.

I haven't really scratched the surface of it all, but all of the mechanics work together to create an exciting gameplay loop that truly innovates the immersive sim genre. I haven't been this invested in a roguelike/lite since FTL, let alone had the desire to go ahead and beat it (only managed to beat FTL on easy after 75 hours...). Currently, I have just unlocked the final fifth character, the hacker, and I am not anywhere near done. 

The additional stuff to the game like the weapons are an excellent bonus too (like the GLOO grenade), and all of it makes it a mechanically superior game to the base game, mostly because you truly get to experience all of what Prey has to offer through it. Plus, it generates some of the best little player-generated stories I have seen in a game. From accidentally mind-blasting myself in the face and being electrocuted to death by blowing up an electrical junction next to me. Or feeling like a total badass slow-mo shotgun-dancing around the typhons while [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4RanjlL7sg) blasts on the background from a loudspeaker.

It's such a shame people wrote it off because ""it has a timer"" or ""it isn't just more Prey, I just want more of Prey's story"". This is MORE than just ""more Prey"", it's unique, it's better, and there is plenty of story to find, and it does have a (light) overarching story too. It really deserves a second chance, dismissing it because ""oh all they did is turn Prey into a roguelite"" is seriously doing it a disservice. It deserves all of the praise it gets. 

If I were to have some criticisms though, the sound is still a bit weird and distant sounds like music can fade out way too quickly, like the base game. Plus, the lack of looking glass stuff is a bit disappointing (unless I have missed something, I am not near beating the game yet), that stuff was awesome in the base game, and it's a shame not to see more of it.

Picked it up long ago from Origin's On The House promotion, and it seems to be okay at the start. It's a bit awkward with the aiming, as such I'm playing one tick below the hardest difficulty. 

Also discovered an odd interaction between DosBox and Google Chrome - as soon as I switch to Chrome, sound from Dosbox gets muted. Can't find out why on a quick glance. 

**X-COM: Interceptor**.

Not one of the popular games in the series, likely because it seems a little less strategic. The prior games in the series had the aliens seem to do a covert style invasion, where they try to undermine X-Com's support, while Interceptor seems to be more of a straight-up combat. The covert method of aliens isn't required (e.g. XCOM 2 does well with it's own way of pressuring the player), but it's strongly recommended. 

The space flight also feels like it needs a bit to get used to. It feels slightly different from the other major spaceflight games, and there wasn't much of an in-game tutorial to get players used to the system. 

Currently experiencing choppy frame rate with that game as well. It seems to be wanting the full framerate, but occasionally stutters.

3317,25,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3318,26,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

3320,28,Eurehetemec,"&gt; 90s and early 00s immersive sims are, imo, some of the best games ever made.

I dunno. I played immersive sims since there were immersive sims. I played UU, but long before that I played stuff like Mercenary/Damocles, which certainly edging towards being an immersive sim, and I loved them. UU and SS are some of my favourite games ever and DE and Thief were not far off.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)

But I think it's easy to get swept up in nostalgia. I don't think that a remake that essentially keeps the game the same, without really improving/changing the gameplay, without really adding depth and complexity to them, would necessarily be terribly compelling. I've replayed DE, and whilst it's cool, the gameplay is pretty awful and simplistic - we have tons of games which do the same general sort of thing, but in a more compelling way, and the plot, whilst cool, feels rather dated and even a bit silly. This actually impacted DE:HR, because the ""illuminati conspiracy"" angle of the plot there was by far the weakest plot element in it, and it would have been better off without it. It seemed a lot more compelling in 2000.

Thief, likewise, if you just did a remake like this, which is a fairly straight remake, and didn't add a ton to it, would seem fairly lightweight and simplistic. Not awful, but people would compare it mildly unfavourably to modern immersive sims. Obviously you don't want to go too far and make it some heavily-scripted bore like the more recent Thief game (which people have mercifully forgotten), but I think you'd want to be looking at smarter AI, possibly more complex tools/equipment, maybe abilities (but the tools/equipment could probably cover that), more complex levels and situations, possibly even more complex goals for the levels.",1548030973,1,1548027373.0,The Sims,0.9997694

3329,37,camycamera,"After beating and loving **Prey: Mooncrash**, I was itching for more immersive sims, so I decided to play **Bioshock: Remastered**. I had the original game and got the Remastered edition for free, but I didn't have the best experience with Bioshock originally. A large part of it I think was that I played it on the hardest difficulty, and that was a dumb mistake because according to the wiki all that does is increase enemy health. It just made it a slog to go through, and since I didn't disable the respawn chamber things (which honestly is just a terrible design decision that just shouldn't be there anyway, I do not see the point of it), I just kept dying and then respawning over and over until I slogged past. So I didn't really enjoy my time with the first game all that much, and it didn't help that the end is a slog regardless. I played it years ago too and I didn't really pay attention to the story, world and themes either (like how it's a criticism of Ayn Rand who, while my knowledge of her is basic, I had no idea who the hell she was when I played it like 8 years ago). I think I had just rushed through it because people were gushing about it. Also because people spoiled you-know-what.

Replaying it now only about 2 hours in (Just killed that surgery artist guy), and my opinion of it has very much softened. Instead of hard difficulty, I put it to normal, which does 100% damage for both the player and enemies which is actually fair and fun. It's great to shoot someone in the head with a pistol and have them die in one or two shots. It's even better to use the plasmids, though. 

The game just oozes with atmosphere and its art-direction is stunning to this day. It's a pleasure to see the leaking, decaying world of Rapture around me, the wonderful post-apocalyptic-retro-futuristic-steampunk feel. The pitter-patter of leaking water against the backdrop of a view of the underwater city, while [""If I didn't care""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdbB6A9wsOc) crackles in the background. It reminded me a lot of the feeling from a long time ago, going through the metro tunnels in Fallout 3, or trekking across the desert in New Vegas, while some great tunes played in the background.

Gameplay is pretty fun, particularly the plasmids, even though it's annoying to have to switch to the plasmids constantly instead of having them one button away like future games have done to improve upon them. The guns feel terrible though. There's no weight to them whatsoever, seemingly no recoil, and the gun sounds, especially the pistol, are *terrible* compared to the rest of the game. The shotgun is great though (having just played it, it feels very similar to Prey's), and having alternate ammo types is always a big plus in shooters. 

As for the hacking mini-game, I have successfully hacked everything that I have found so far, but boy I feel like it's gonna get old really quick. I wish there was a mod to just import Bioshock 2's hacking system into the first game, because that hacking system was nothing short of genius. Speaking of mods, I installed some sound quality mod for the cutscenes and a UI fixer mod for the subtitles to work better in 1080p, because people said the remaster was a little sloppy in those areas. But aside from that, no technical problems so far.

But yeah, I'm looking forward to beating it, I haven't played it in so long so it's a bit like playing a new game anyway. Depending on how much I enjoy it, I'll definitely look into trying the Bioshock 2 remaster too. I remember that I enjoyed that game's combat much more, too. Won't be replaying Infinite though. As pretty as it is, considering the majority of it is a boring shooting gallery, playing it on normal probably won't do much for me to enjoy actually playing it more (I originally played it on hard difficulty).",1549378935,1,1549375335.0,The Sims,0.9984205

When SimCity tanked, EA panicked and ripped out all of the 'online-only' content out of Sims 4 and released a fucking broken, shitty Sims game that took almost two years of patches and content releases to resemble something fans of the series were familiar with (and without the shitty loading screens fixed (because they couldn't be fixed, because the loading screens were necessary to load online content that was a fundamental part of the game)).

So now we have Anthem, and this is exactly what I told every single friend I have would happen, EA panicked when Battlefront II tanked and went back in to Anthem and had to rip out all of the pay-to-win microtransactions and that did two things:

1) It fundamentally broke Anthem as a game as they had to go back and change every system, UI element, etc. in the game to not just remove the pay-to-win microtrans, but to erase evidence that they were ever there to begin with.

2) This meant that their dev resources that should have been working on polish and QA for all their release platforms were instead grinding day in and day out to make the game look like it never had a fundamental pay-to-win ecosystem of loot boxes and microtrans.

This is especially evident in the PC port, which is naturally where EA would put the fewest of their resources, so you have fundamentally broken and shitty-looking UI elements that are obvious evidence of panicked, patchwork solutions while the main bulk of the dev team focused on getting the console-releases polished for launch.

It is a testament to EA's greed and I truly hope Anthem tanks and does real financial harm to them as a company.",1549231843,1,1549228243.0,The Sims,0.00022522277

&gt;Where is the BIG innovation that sequels bring?

See my other comment, a lot of that was already in the sims 3 as well.. in some form, at least.

CAS was a major improvement (IMO), Building has more basement levels and more heights,more wall heights, terrian building is a lot better and easier to use, plus the height is higher. You can travel between worlds and play multiple families without losing progress

Gardening and fishing are basegame and gardening has been overhauled to work better. First Person Camera view, Photography skill that allows you to take selfies and pictures &amp; hang them on the wall.

Toddlers are way better then before, ( having more skills, more interactions, being able to do more things etc.), There's a semi-active job base game.

With expansions, off the top of my head, Seasons, let's you create your own holidays, gives you a calendar where you can plan things days ahead and see the weather. There's also a hot and cold section, so what you wear along with thermostat effects you're sims.

Get together allows you to make custom clubs, along with a bunch of perks you can earn to get buffs, Vampires come with a world, they have skill trees, Perks and Cons (i think they are called cons) they have tiers.

and these are just things off the top of my head.

* Project Highrise.  Kinda the opposite of Factorio where I found it way too easy and it got stale after like 7 hours or so.
* Most recently, Frostpunk.  I'm currently working on the Fall of Winterhome campaign (Definitely harder than I thought it would be), but it's easily my favorite of the three.  I don't know if it will have legs in Endless Mode though because the book of laws and tech tree both feel too small, but the book of laws (for what it is) is probably my favorite system in the game.

People are wary of subscription services and EA has spent decades teaching this game's core userbase to pay large amounts for small amounts of content (vs. their value/dollar when buying other game software), so I think this would be a mistake that cost them money. Additionally, they have already released a ton of content to their audience as DLC and the people who are interested have already purchased it. If they want to make more money and grow their audience, they should create a software bundle that includes the complete The Sims 4 experience and sell it for $60. Then they could start work on The Sims 5 and if they create an online component (that is actually fun) and offer regular free content updates, they could consider a subscription fee in line with other MMOs.

3397,105,team56th,"We need to talk about **Anthem**.

So far the impression I've got from people around me is that they are hesitant to say they like it. There are various and obvious reasons behind this: being an unpopular hot take is one, demo's contents are limited, we still don't know how the endgame and post-launch support will turn out, etc.

But even then the pattern goes like this: They say one or two things they don't like, and then go on to explain what they did with the game, what they plan to do in the next round or next week, etc. The game is doing something right.

What is it?

* The overall structure of the combat is closest to Doom (2016). Doom makes an arena and then encourages you to play aggressive so that you can retrieve health and ammo. Because only the shield will auto-recover and some of the best weapons will always be in need of ammo, you have to keep killing to refill things. This is exactly how Anthem plays out. For better or worse it's very much a wave-based arena shooter and the goal is to clear out the horde of enemies in the most effective possible way.

* This will not work if the combat is bland. Here the keyword is **flexibility**. Anthem combines the combat style of *all* of the recent Bioware games; you often get the callbacks to rogues and mages in Dragon Age, Vanguard in Mass Effect, etc. And all of these styles work while being widely different from each other. The guns themselves may come off as weak as was the case in Mass Effect games, but the combination of all other abilities and gadgets makes it very engaging, especially when your party is comprised of different classes and styles.

* After the first mission I immediately realized why Bioware went with this mission for the demo. I was initially not sold on the ""our world, your story"" initiative, but if the demo is any indication, Bioware seems to have some ideas to make it fun. &gt;!The 3 confused Dominion enemies in the combat leading to the cloned Matthias with 3 different persona in the story hub was a nice touch IMO, not to mention the subtle jokes about how to call Matthias...es after the incident.!&lt; It all feels playful while not going for entirely in-your-face jokes. I have high hopes that the storytelling will be way better than existing options.

* A friend told me after the alpha test that the map *feels* big. Now I know why. The planar size may not be that big, but due to  how vertical and detailed it is, it was very difficult to fully digest what the world looks like. So on one hand I would definitely like a custom waypoint system, since it's rather easy to get lost. But overall it's a great design.

* Jetpack does not play like I expected. I think everybody would agree on this one. It does not feel like controlling a *character*, but rather a *machine*, sort of like how you control fighters in arcade flight sims. Once you accept this however, it feels special. It's weighty while feeling precise enough at the same time. But it definitely wouldn't translate well to KB/M, which IMO is the reason why people hate KB/M control on PC. Not sure if it will ever get solved.

Overall, an unmistakably Bioware game while being system-based rather than narrative-based. After ditching D&amp;D rules Bioware has long struggled to make a system of its own, which was rather successful with Mass Effect while not so with Dragon Age. Anthem goes full systems-based using Mass Effect 3 as a foundation, and it feels good. Here's to hoping the feel extends throughout all of the launch contents and beyond.",1548641354,16,1548637754.0,The Sims,0.044927817

3402,110,camycamera,"I finally put down **Dragon Age: Origins** after about 100 hours, having finished the Awakening and Witch Hunt DLC, didn't bother with the other DLCs, as to be honest, I was ready to put the game down in favour of another one (although that alternate ending DLC is extremely interesting as a concept, never heard of any other sort of DLC done like that!). 

The samey levels and encounters were starting to creep up on me too. But still, DA:O's/Witch Hunt's endings left me vaguely intrigued to have a go at DA2 and especially Inquisition (also because of the graphical and animation improvements for the latter). 

Awakening was a pretty good, albeit kinda short, *really* buggy (like the base game) with an abrupt ending, and the lack of the majority of the main game companions was disappointing. You see the mage Wynne once but never again, and you can't even ask her how Shale (best Golemn companion ever) was going these days. The new companions were really great, but man, nothing beats Alistar and Morrigan's banter. But overall, DA:O is an interesting beast though. Wish it had more of a budget like Mass Effect did, though.

**Prey: Mooncrash** is the game I was looking forward to playing after DA:O, and boy.... I'm about 10 hours into it, and it might just be better than the main game, and I *loved* the main game! Having characters as classes is a GENIUS idea, as, unlike the base game where how you get around and do things mostly just depends on what tree you were interested in going down (and I bet most went down the typhon route, as it has the coolest and OP abilities in the game), with classes, you have to get familiar with ALL of what the game has to offer. 

How you engage things like combat is going to be vastly different for each. For example, the soldier is at his best getting up close and personal with his shotgun, able to tank damage and deal loads of it, and be extremely manoeuvrable thanks to higher stamina/athletics, and abilities like slow-mo. Meanwhile, the director is probably at her best hiding as a mug while her typhon does the hard work.

And even better, what you do is persistent, so who you decide to go through first can be helpful later, like fixing a door as the engineer for the soldier to go through later. You can summon a bot to store items between characters too for convenience.

There's no manual save, so you have to live with your mistakes which works fantastic with immersive sims, and if you die, you die, but since there is always progress even in death. The timer, which brings in harder enemies as the game goes on until time runs out and you have to reset, puts you on your toes and to be efficient and not to turtle like the little bitch you probably were in the original game, but isn't so fast as to discourage exploration and soaking in the atmosphere.

I haven't really scratched the surface of it all, but all of the mechanics work together to create an exciting gameplay loop that truly innovates the immersive sim genre. I haven't been this invested in a roguelike/lite since FTL, let alone had the desire to go ahead and beat it (only managed to beat FTL on easy after 75 hours...). Currently, I have just unlocked the final fifth character, the hacker, and I am not anywhere near done. 

The additional stuff to the game like the weapons are an excellent bonus too (like the GLOO grenade), and all of it makes it a mechanically superior game to the base game, mostly because you truly get to experience all of what Prey has to offer through it. Plus, it generates some of the best little player-generated stories I have seen in a game. From accidentally mind-blasting myself in the face and being electrocuted to death by blowing up an electrical junction next to me. Or feeling like a total badass slow-mo shotgun-dancing around the typhons while [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4RanjlL7sg) blasts on the background from a loudspeaker.

It's such a shame people wrote it off because ""it has a timer"" or ""it isn't just more Prey, I just want more of Prey's story"". This is MORE than just ""more Prey"", it's unique, it's better, and there is plenty of story to find, and it does have a (light) overarching story too. It really deserves a second chance, dismissing it because ""oh all they did is turn Prey into a roguelite"" is seriously doing it a disservice. It deserves all of the praise it gets. 

If I were to have some criticisms though, the sound is still a bit weird and distant sounds like music can fade out way too quickly, like the base game. Plus, the lack of looking glass stuff is a bit disappointing (unless I have missed something, I am not near beating the game yet), that stuff was awesome in the base game, and it's a shame not to see more of it.

3404,112,imjustamazing,"My main issue with your analogies is that none of them are niche interests.  It's not that hard to find someone on staff who plays FPSes or knows sports, for example.  The number of fighting game/flight sim enthusiasts is already pretty low, and then that number plops even lower in the game journalist field.  So if a big flight sim is coming out, and no one on staff plays flight sims, is it fair to ignore it?  When it comes to genres that are less explored, yes I do believe a novice perspective is important.  They can answer the question ""Is this something new players can have fun getting into?"" 

At the end of the day, I believe that transparency is key.  Any reviewer should be upfront about how much of the game they played, and previous experience with these games, if any.  ""Hey guys, I never played a flight sim before, but I'm giving Ace Combat 7 a fair shot.  Here's what my experience was like.""

It's not like learning flight sims, where you need to start by actually playing the game first, and then seeing how the game eases you into it.

They can either say ""this isn't a good book to read if you're learning Japanese"" or ""this book has helped my Japanese immensely and I recommend it if you're still learning.""

**Crusader: No Remorse**. 

Picked it up long ago from Origin's On The House promotion, and it seems to be okay at the start. It's a bit awkward with the aiming, as such I'm playing one tick below the hardest difficulty. 

Also discovered an odd interaction between DosBox and Google Chrome - as soon as I switch to Chrome, sound from Dosbox gets muted. Can't find out why on a quick glance. 

**X-COM: Interceptor**.

Not one of the popular games in the series, likely because it seems a little less strategic. The prior games in the series had the aliens seem to do a covert style invasion, where they try to undermine X-Com's support, while Interceptor seems to be more of a straight-up combat. The covert method of aliens isn't required (e.g. XCOM 2 does well with it's own way of pressuring the player), but it's strongly recommended. 

The space flight also feels like it needs a bit to get used to. It feels slightly different from the other major spaceflight games, and there wasn't much of an in-game tutorial to get players used to the system. 

Currently experiencing choppy frame rate with that game as well. It seems to be wanting the full framerate, but occasionally stutters.

3417,125,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3418,126,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me). But, like i said, i barely played it, let's see how it goes...",1547425331,1,1547421731.0,The Sims,0.7532972

3420,128,Eurehetemec,"&gt; 90s and early 00s immersive sims are, imo, some of the best games ever made.

I dunno. I played immersive sims since there were immersive sims. I played UU, but long before that I played stuff like Mercenary/Damocles, which certainly edging towards being an immersive sim, and I loved them. UU and SS are some of my favourite games ever and DE and Thief were not far off.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)

But I think it's easy to get swept up in nostalgia. I don't think that a remake that essentially keeps the game the same, without really improving/changing the gameplay, without really adding depth and complexity to them, would necessarily be terribly compelling. I've replayed DE, and whilst it's cool, the gameplay is pretty awful and simplistic - we have tons of games which do the same general sort of thing, but in a more compelling way, and the plot, whilst cool, feels rather dated and even a bit silly. This actually impacted DE:HR, because the ""illuminati conspiracy"" angle of the plot there was by far the weakest plot element in it, and it would have been better off without it. It seemed a lot more compelling in 2000.

Thief, likewise, if you just did a remake like this, which is a fairly straight remake, and didn't add a ton to it, would seem fairly lightweight and simplistic. Not awful, but people would compare it mildly unfavourably to modern immersive sims. Obviously you don't want to go too far and make it some heavily-scripted bore like the more recent Thief game (which people have mercifully forgotten), but I think you'd want to be looking at smarter AI, possibly more complex tools/equipment, maybe abilities (but the tools/equipment could probably cover that), more complex levels and situations, possibly even more complex goals for the levels.",1548030973,1,1548027373.0,The Sims,0.9997694

3429,137,camycamera,"After beating and loving **Prey: Mooncrash**, I was itching for more immersive sims, so I decided to play **Bioshock: Remastered**. I had the original game and got the Remastered edition for free, but I didn't have the best experience with Bioshock originally. A large part of it I think was that I played it on the hardest difficulty, and that was a dumb mistake because according to the wiki all that does is increase enemy health. It just made it a slog to go through, and since I didn't disable the respawn chamber things (which honestly is just a terrible design decision that just shouldn't be there anyway, I do not see the point of it), I just kept dying and then respawning over and over until I slogged past. So I didn't really enjoy my time with the first game all that much, and it didn't help that the end is a slog regardless. I played it years ago too and I didn't really pay attention to the story, world and themes either (like how it's a criticism of Ayn Rand who, while my knowledge of her is basic, I had no idea who the hell she was when I played it like 8 years ago). I think I had just rushed through it because people were gushing about it. Also because people spoiled you-know-what.

Replaying it now only about 2 hours in (Just killed that surgery artist guy), and my opinion of it has very much softened. Instead of hard difficulty, I put it to normal, which does 100% damage for both the player and enemies which is actually fair and fun. It's great to shoot someone in the head with a pistol and have them die in one or two shots. It's even better to use the plasmids, though. 

The game just oozes with atmosphere and its art-direction is stunning to this day. It's a pleasure to see the leaking, decaying world of Rapture around me, the wonderful post-apocalyptic-retro-futuristic-steampunk feel. The pitter-patter of leaking water against the backdrop of a view of the underwater city, while [""If I didn't care""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdbB6A9wsOc) crackles in the background. It reminded me a lot of the feeling from a long time ago, going through the metro tunnels in Fallout 3, or trekking across the desert in New Vegas, while some great tunes played in the background.

Gameplay is pretty fun, particularly the plasmids, even though it's annoying to have to switch to the plasmids constantly instead of having them one button away like future games have done to improve upon them. The guns feel terrible though. There's no weight to them whatsoever, seemingly no recoil, and the gun sounds, especially the pistol, are *terrible* compared to the rest of the game. The shotgun is great though (having just played it, it feels very similar to Prey's), and having alternate ammo types is always a big plus in shooters. 

As for the hacking mini-game, I have successfully hacked everything that I have found so far, but boy I feel like it's gonna get old really quick. I wish there was a mod to just import Bioshock 2's hacking system into the first game, because that hacking system was nothing short of genius. Speaking of mods, I installed some sound quality mod for the cutscenes and a UI fixer mod for the subtitles to work better in 1080p, because people said the remaster was a little sloppy in those areas. But aside from that, no technical problems so far.

But yeah, I'm looking forward to beating it, I haven't played it in so long so it's a bit like playing a new game anyway. Depending on how much I enjoy it, I'll definitely look into trying the Bioshock 2 remaster too. I remember that I enjoyed that game's combat much more, too. Won't be replaying Infinite though. As pretty as it is, considering the majority of it is a boring shooting gallery, playing it on normal probably won't do much for me to enjoy actually playing it more (I originally played it on hard difficulty).",1549378935,1,1549375335.0,The Sims,0.9984205

3431,139,RussiaWillFail,"Ahahahaha, yup, this is exactly what happened with Sims 4. When SimCity tanked, EA panicked and ripped out all of the 'online-only' content out of Sims 4 and released a fucking broken, shitty Sims game that took almost two years of patches and content releases to resemble something fans of the series were familiar with (and without the shitty loading screens fixed (because they couldn't be fixed, because the loading screens were necessary to load online content that was a fundamental part of the game)).

So now we have Anthem, and this is exactly what I told every single friend I have would happen, EA panicked when Battlefront II tanked and went back in to Anthem and had to rip out all of the pay-to-win microtransactions and that did two things:

1) It fundamentally broke Anthem as a game as they had to go back and change every system, UI element, etc. in the game to not just remove the pay-to-win microtrans, but to erase evidence that they were ever there to begin with.

2) This meant that their dev resources that should have been working on polish and QA for all their release platforms were instead grinding day in and day out to make the game look like it never had a fundamental pay-to-win ecosystem of loot boxes and microtrans.

This is especially evident in the PC port, which is naturally where EA would put the fewest of their resources, so you have fundamentally broken and shitty-looking UI elements that are obvious evidence of panicked, patchwork solutions while the main bulk of the dev team focused on getting the console-releases polished for launch.

It is a testament to EA's greed and I truly hope Anthem tanks and does real financial harm to them as a company.",1549231843,1,1549228243.0,The Sims,0.00022522277

CAS was a major improvement (IMO), Building has more basement levels and more heights,more wall heights, terrian building is a lot better and easier to use, plus the height is higher.

Gardening and fishing are basegame and gardening has been overhauled to work better. First Person Camera view, Photography skill that allows you to take selfies and pictures &amp; hang them on the wall.

Toddlers are way better then before, ( having more skills, more interactions, being able to do more things etc.), There's a semi-active job base game.

With expansions, off the top of my head, Seasons, let's you create your own holidays, gives you a calendar where you can plan things days ahead and see the weather. There's also a hot and cold section, so what you wear along with thermostat effects you're sims.

Get together allows you to make custom clubs, along with a bunch of perks you can earn to get buffs, Vampires come with a world, they have skill trees, Perks and Cons (i think they are called cons) they have tiers.

People are wary of subscription services and EA has spent decades teaching this game's core userbase to pay large amounts for small amounts of content (vs. their value/dollar when buying other game software), so I think this would be a mistake that cost them money. Additionally, they have already released a ton of content to their audience as DLC and the people who are interested have already purchased it. If they want to make more money and grow their audience, they should create a software bundle that includes the complete The Sims 4 experience and sell it for $60.

Jonathan Ive from Apple said that focus groups ensure you don't offend anyone, and produce bland and inoffensive products. Steve Jobs echoed that sentiment. 

I'm not saying focus groups or market research are useless... they're multi-billion dollar industries. The ubiquity of mobile games combined with its marriage to market research (i.e. figure out how to pry money from people) speaks volumes. Usability testing is very important for finding snags and pitfalls. Put that aside, because the main thing I'm saying is that pulling the ""It's market research, so they're right, you're wrong"" card in an argument is cheesy. The flip side is reverse - with regards to Bioware I can't point to Mass Effect: Andromeda or Anthem, both of which I think are boring and bland as shit, and say the game was bland because of focus groups, because I don't work at Bioware.

Club leaders decide what restrictions exist to enter the club, and what activities that club will focus on performing - up to 5. They can also ban up to 5 different types of activities.

3497,205,team56th,"We need to talk about **Anthem**.

So far the impression I've got from people around me is that they are hesitant to say they like it. There are various and obvious reasons behind this: being an unpopular hot take is one, demo's contents are limited, we still don't know how the endgame and post-launch support will turn out, etc.

But even then the pattern goes like this: They say one or two things they don't like, and then go on to explain what they did with the game, what they plan to do in the next round or next week, etc. The game is doing something right.

What is it?

* The overall structure of the combat is closest to Doom (2016). Doom makes an arena and then encourages you to play aggressive so that you can retrieve health and ammo. Because only the shield will auto-recover and some of the best weapons will always be in need of ammo, you have to keep killing to refill things. This is exactly how Anthem plays out. For better or worse it's very much a wave-based arena shooter and the goal is to clear out the horde of enemies in the most effective possible way.

* This will not work if the combat is bland. Here the keyword is **flexibility**. Anthem combines the combat style of *all* of the recent Bioware games; you often get the callbacks to rogues and mages in Dragon Age, Vanguard in Mass Effect, etc. And all of these styles work while being widely different from each other. The guns themselves may come off as weak as was the case in Mass Effect games, but the combination of all other abilities and gadgets makes it very engaging, especially when your party is comprised of different classes and styles.

* After the first mission I immediately realized why Bioware went with this mission for the demo. I was initially not sold on the ""our world, your story"" initiative, but if the demo is any indication, Bioware seems to have some ideas to make it fun. &gt;!The 3 confused Dominion enemies in the combat leading to the cloned Matthias with 3 different persona in the story hub was a nice touch IMO, not to mention the subtle jokes about how to call Matthias...es after the incident.!&lt; It all feels playful while not going for entirely in-your-face jokes. I have high hopes that the storytelling will be way better than existing options.

* A friend told me after the alpha test that the map *feels* big. Now I know why. The planar size may not be that big, but due to  how vertical and detailed it is, it was very difficult to fully digest what the world looks like. So on one hand I would definitely like a custom waypoint system, since it's rather easy to get lost. But overall it's a great design.

* Jetpack does not play like I expected. I think everybody would agree on this one. It does not feel like controlling a *character*, but rather a *machine*, sort of like how you control fighters in arcade flight sims. Once you accept this however, it feels special. It's weighty while feeling precise enough at the same time. But it definitely wouldn't translate well to KB/M, which IMO is the reason why people hate KB/M control on PC. Not sure if it will ever get solved.

Overall, an unmistakably Bioware game while being system-based rather than narrative-based. After ditching D&amp;D rules Bioware has long struggled to make a system of its own, which was rather successful with Mass Effect while not so with Dragon Age. Anthem goes full systems-based using Mass Effect 3 as a foundation, and it feels good.

The samey levels and encounters were starting to creep up on me too. But still, DA:O's/Witch Hunt's endings left me vaguely intrigued to have a go at DA2 and especially Inquisition (also because of the graphical and animation improvements for the latter). 

Awakening was a pretty good, albeit kinda short, *really* buggy (like the base game) with an abrupt ending, and the lack of the majority of the main game companions was disappointing. You see the mage Wynne once but never again, and you can't even ask her how Shale (best Golemn companion ever) was going these days. The new companions were really great, but man, nothing beats Alistar and Morrigan's banter. But overall, DA:O is an interesting beast though. Wish it had more of a budget like Mass Effect did, though.

**Prey: Mooncrash** is the game I was looking forward to playing after DA:O, and boy.... I'm about 10 hours into it, and it might just be better than the main game, and I *loved* the main game! Having characters as classes is a GENIUS idea, as, unlike the base game where how you get around and do things mostly just depends on what tree you were interested in going down (and I bet most went down the typhon route, as it has the coolest and OP abilities in the game), with classes, you have to get familiar with ALL of what the game has to offer. 

How you engage things like combat is going to be vastly different for each. For example, the soldier is at his best getting up close and personal with his shotgun, able to tank damage and deal loads of it, and be extremely manoeuvrable thanks to higher stamina/athletics, and abilities like slow-mo. Meanwhile, the director is probably at her best hiding as a mug while her typhon does the hard work.

And even better, what you do is persistent, so who you decide to go through first can be helpful later, like fixing a door as the engineer for the soldier to go through later. You can summon a bot to store items between characters too for convenience.

There's no manual save, so you have to live with your mistakes which works fantastic with immersive sims, and if you die, you die, but since there is always progress even in death. The timer, which brings in harder enemies as the game goes on until time runs out and you have to reset, puts you on your toes and to be efficient and not to turtle like the little bitch you probably were in the original game, but isn't so fast as to discourage exploration and soaking in the atmosphere.

I haven't really scratched the surface of it all, but all of the mechanics work together to create an exciting gameplay loop that truly innovates the immersive sim genre. I haven't been this invested in a roguelike/lite since FTL, let alone had the desire to go ahead and beat it (only managed to beat FTL on easy after 75 hours...). Currently, I have just unlocked the final fifth character, the hacker, and I am not anywhere near done. 

The additional stuff to the game like the weapons are an excellent bonus too (like the GLOO grenade), and all of it makes it a mechanically superior game to the base game, mostly because you truly get to experience all of what Prey has to offer through it. Plus, it generates some of the best little player-generated stories I have seen in a game. From accidentally mind-blasting myself in the face and being electrocuted to death by blowing up an electrical junction next to me. Or feeling like a total badass slow-mo shotgun-dancing around the typhons while [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4RanjlL7sg) blasts on the background from a loudspeaker.

It's such a shame people wrote it off because ""it has a timer"" or ""it isn't just more Prey, I just want more of Prey's story"". This is MORE than just ""more Prey"", it's unique, it's better, and there is plenty of story to find, and it does have a (light) overarching story too. It really deserves a second chance, dismissing it because ""oh all they did is turn Prey into a roguelite"" is seriously doing it a disservice. It deserves all of the praise it gets. 

If I were to have some criticisms though, the sound is still a bit weird and distant sounds like music can fade out way too quickly, like the base game. Plus, the lack of looking glass stuff is a bit disappointing (unless I have missed something, I am not near beating the game yet), that stuff was awesome in the base game, and it's a shame not to see more of it.

The number of fighting game/flight sim enthusiasts is already pretty low, and then that number plops even lower in the game journalist field.  So if a big flight sim is coming out, and no one on staff plays flight sims, is it fair to ignore it?  When it comes to genres that are less explored, yes I do believe a novice perspective is important.  They can answer the question ""Is this something new players can have fun getting into?"" 

At the end of the day, I believe that transparency is key.  Any reviewer should be upfront about how much of the game they played, and previous experience with these games, if any.  ""Hey guys, I never played a flight sim before, but I'm giving Ace Combat 7 a fair shot.  Here's what my experience was like.""

It's not like learning flight sims, where you need to start by actually playing the game first, and then seeing how the game eases you into it.  The only way the novice could review the Japanese novel would be if they wrote the review from that perspective.  They can either say ""this isn't a good book to read if you're learning Japanese"" or ""this book has helped my Japanese immensely and I recommend it if you're still learning.""

**Crusader: No Remorse**. 

Picked it up long ago from Origin's On The House promotion, and it seems to be okay at the start. It's a bit awkward with the aiming, as such I'm playing one tick below the hardest difficulty. 

Also discovered an odd interaction between DosBox and Google Chrome - as soon as I switch to Chrome, sound from Dosbox gets muted. Can't find out why on a quick glance. 

**X-COM: Interceptor**.

Not one of the popular games in the series, likely because it seems a little less strategic. The prior games in the series had the aliens seem to do a covert style invasion, where they try to undermine X-Com's support, while Interceptor seems to be more of a straight-up combat. The covert method of aliens isn't required (e.g. XCOM 2 does well with it's own way of pressuring the player), but it's strongly recommended. 

The space flight also feels like it needs a bit to get used to. It feels slightly different from the other major spaceflight games, and there wasn't much of an in-game tutorial to get players used to the system. 

Currently experiencing choppy frame rate with that game as well. It seems to be wanting the full framerate, but occasionally stutters. 

**Wings of Dawn**. 

Naturally, playing a FreeSpace 2 mod tends to make other less-refined space sims look a little weak.

3517,225,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3518,226,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

3520,228,Eurehetemec,"&gt; 90s and early 00s immersive sims are, imo, some of the best games ever made.

I dunno. I played immersive sims since there were immersive sims. I played UU, but long before that I played stuff like Mercenary/Damocles, which certainly edging towards being an immersive sim, and I loved them. UU and SS are some of my favourite games ever and DE and Thief were not far off.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)

But I think it's easy to get swept up in nostalgia. I don't think that a remake that essentially keeps the game the same, without really improving/changing the gameplay, without really adding depth and complexity to them, would necessarily be terribly compelling. I've replayed DE, and whilst it's cool, the gameplay is pretty awful and simplistic - we have tons of games which do the same general sort of thing, but in a more compelling way, and the plot, whilst cool, feels rather dated and even a bit silly. This actually impacted DE:HR, because the ""illuminati conspiracy"" angle of the plot there was by far the weakest plot element in it, and it would have been better off without it. It seemed a lot more compelling in 2000.

Thief, likewise, if you just did a remake like this, which is a fairly straight remake, and didn't add a ton to it, would seem fairly lightweight and simplistic. Not awful, but people would compare it mildly unfavourably to modern immersive sims. Obviously you don't want to go too far and make it some heavily-scripted bore like the more recent Thief game (which people have mercifully forgotten), but I think you'd want to be looking at smarter AI, possibly more complex tools/equipment, maybe abilities (but the tools/equipment could probably cover that), more complex levels and situations, possibly even more complex goals for the levels.",1548030973,1,1548027373.0,The Sims,0.9997694

A large part of it I think was that I played it on the hardest difficulty, and that was a dumb mistake because according to the wiki all that does is increase enemy health. It just made it a slog to go through, and since I didn't disable the respawn chamber things (which honestly is just a terrible design decision that just shouldn't be there anyway, I do not see the point of it), I just kept dying and then respawning over and over until I slogged past. So I didn't really enjoy my time with the first game all that much, and it didn't help that the end is a slog regardless. I played it years ago too and I didn't really pay attention to the story, world and themes either (like how it's a criticism of Ayn Rand who, while my knowledge of her is basic, I had no idea who the hell she was when I played it like 8 years ago). I think I had just rushed through it because people were gushing about it. Also because people spoiled you-know-what.

Replaying it now only about 2 hours in (Just killed that surgery artist guy), and my opinion of it has very much softened. Instead of hard difficulty, I put it to normal, which does 100% damage for both the player and enemies which is actually fair and fun. It's great to shoot someone in the head with a pistol and have them die in one or two shots. It's even better to use the plasmids, though. 

The game just oozes with atmosphere and its art-direction is stunning to this day. It's a pleasure to see the leaking, decaying world of Rapture around me, the wonderful post-apocalyptic-retro-futuristic-steampunk feel. The pitter-patter of leaking water against the backdrop of a view of the underwater city, while [""If I didn't care""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdbB6A9wsOc) crackles in the background. It reminded me a lot of the feeling from a long time ago, going through the metro tunnels in Fallout 3, or trekking across the desert in New Vegas, while some great tunes played in the background.

Gameplay is pretty fun, particularly the plasmids, even though it's annoying to have to switch to the plasmids constantly instead of having them one button away like future games have done to improve upon them. The guns feel terrible though. There's no weight to them whatsoever, seemingly no recoil, and the gun sounds, especially the pistol, are *terrible* compared to the rest of the game. The shotgun is great though (having just played it, it feels very similar to Prey's), and having alternate ammo types is always a big plus in shooters. 

As for the hacking mini-game, I have successfully hacked everything that I have found so far, but boy I feel like it's gonna get old really quick. I wish there was a mod to just import Bioshock 2's hacking system into the first game, because that hacking system was nothing short of genius. Speaking of mods, I installed some sound quality mod for the cutscenes and a UI fixer mod for the subtitles to work better in 1080p, because people said the remaster was a little sloppy in those areas. But aside from that, no technical problems so far.

But yeah, I'm looking forward to beating it, I haven't played it in so long so it's a bit like playing a new game anyway. Depending on how much I enjoy it, I'll definitely look into trying the Bioshock 2 remaster too. I remember that I enjoyed that game's combat much more, too. Won't be replaying Infinite though. As pretty as it is, considering the majority of it is a boring shooting gallery, playing it on normal probably won't do much for me to enjoy actually playing it more (I originally played it on hard difficulty).",1549378935,1,1549375335.0,The Sims,0.9984205

3531,239,RussiaWillFail,"Ahahahaha, yup, this is exactly what happened with Sims 4. When SimCity tanked, EA panicked and ripped out all of the 'online-only' content out of Sims 4 and released a fucking broken, shitty Sims game that took almost two years of patches and content releases to resemble something fans of the series were familiar with (and without the shitty loading screens fixed (because they couldn't be fixed, because the loading screens were necessary to load online content that was a fundamental part of the game)).

So now we have Anthem, and this is exactly what I told every single friend I have would happen, EA panicked when Battlefront II tanked and went back in to Anthem and had to rip out all of the pay-to-win microtransactions and that did two things:

1) It fundamentally broke Anthem as a game as they had to go back and change every system, UI element, etc. in the game to not just remove the pay-to-win microtrans, but to erase evidence that they were ever there to begin with.

2) This meant that their dev resources that should have been working on polish and QA for all their release platforms were instead grinding day in and day out to make the game look like it never had a fundamental pay-to-win ecosystem of loot boxes and microtrans.

This is especially evident in the PC port, which is naturally where EA would put the fewest of their resources, so you have fundamentally broken and shitty-looking UI elements that are obvious evidence of panicked, patchwork solutions while the main bulk of the dev team focused on getting the console-releases polished for launch.

It is a testament to EA's greed and I truly hope Anthem tanks and does real financial harm to them as a company.",1549231843,1,1549228243.0,The Sims,0.00022522277

* Project Highrise.  Kinda the opposite of Factorio where I found it way too easy and it got stale after like 7 hours or so.
* Most recently, Frostpunk.  I'm currently working on the Fall of Winterhome campaign (Definitely harder than I thought it would be), but it's easily my favorite of the three.  I don't know if it will have legs in Endless Mode though because the book of laws and tech tree both feel too small, but the book of laws (for what it is) is probably my favorite system in the game.

People are wary of subscription services and EA has spent decades teaching this game's core userbase to pay large amounts for small amounts of content (vs. their value/dollar when buying other game software), so I think this would be a mistake that cost them money. Additionally, they have already released a ton of content to their audience as DLC and the people who are interested have already purchased it. If they want to make more money and grow their audience, they should create a software bundle that includes the complete The Sims 4 experience and sell it for $60. Then they could start work on The Sims 5 and if they create an online component (that is actually fun) and offer regular free content updates, they could consider a subscription fee in line with other MMOs.

Jonathan Ive from Apple said that focus groups ensure you don't offend anyone, and produce bland and inoffensive products. Steve Jobs echoed that sentiment. 

I'm not saying focus groups or market research are useless... they're multi-billion dollar industries. The ubiquity of mobile games combined with its marriage to market research (i.e. figure out how to pry money from people) speaks volumes. Usability testing is very important for finding snags and pitfalls. Put that aside, because the main thing I'm saying is that pulling the ""It's market research, so they're right, you're wrong"" card in an argument is cheesy.

Destiny 2 was just shit, the gearing was just plain bad and never picked up the DLCs as they demand way too much compared to just 1 season pass from division. The way they had auto enemy scaling was just a joke beyond joke.

Warframe I have something similar, but I found that as you min max you trivialize the content, and its got way too easy as I have a few melee weapon with meming strike and rivens that give them more damage..., and even then a few of my guns with rivens are just monsters with no equal and again, what challenge is there if my Rubico and Vectis can one shot almost anything, my kitgun can do gobs of arca plasmor like AoE, and then a meming polararm means I can slice up crap that comes close (or just all the hall ways possible).

So due to the drought I might have to pick this one up and open my mind a bit to the arcade. VR support for anything cockpit related is game changing so I'm ready.  ",1547800039,1,1547796439.0,The Sims,0.00053723285

3571,279,TeaAndMeatballs,"Nearly every dev studio that died under EA was the fault of the dev studio.

Take Westwood, for instance. When they were purchased by EA, they had a C&amp;C game in development. EA decided to not get involved and just told them to continue with what they were doing. This game ended up being a critical failure and contributed to their demise.

Maxis the same. I think SIM City 3000 was in development when EA bought them. Continued to develop. Was highly praised. Sim City 4 was developed, praised but didn't sell well.

Ya see, EA are a business. They want to make money. Just because a game is good doesn't necessarily mean that it is going to sell, does it?

You (and many gamers) seem to think that EA should pump money into something which is not going to make them money. EA gave these companies a chance and they couldn't make cash. Westwood would have died without EA anyway. EA gave them an opportunity to make another C&amp;C game after their previous one failed. It also failed. They would not have had that second opportunity without EA, would they?

Technically it's a gatcha game because you unlock characters and equipment through loot boxes, but the game gives a regular amount of premium currency for free daily and a lot of equipment and characters can be unlocked without opening a single loot box. Not to mention that because it's skill based, you don't actually ""need"" the latest characters or gear. It's the only mobile game I've seen make a real effort to put in a huge variety of gameplay modes and events. Just to name a few:

* There's the main character action combat, which has no right to be this smooth on mobile phones
* There's an open world mode with weekly quests on a large map
* There's a base building mechanic with a ""Sims / Animal crossing"" thing where you decorate rooms with furniture
* There's weekly challenges that come in the form of: platformer, SHMUP, turret shooter, and giant robot fights

I've only played for a little under 2 months and I have 25 characters unlocked. There's like 35 in the game right now.

3588,296,team56th,"We need to talk about **Anthem**.

So far the impression I've got from people around me is that they are hesitant to say they like it. There are various and obvious reasons behind this: being an unpopular hot take is one, demo's contents are limited, we still don't know how the endgame and post-launch support will turn out, etc.

But even then the pattern goes like this: They say one or two things they don't like, and then go on to explain what they did with the game, what they plan to do in the next round or next week, etc. The game is doing something right.

What is it?

* The overall structure of the combat is closest to Doom (2016). Doom makes an arena and then encourages you to play aggressive so that you can retrieve health and ammo. Because only the shield will auto-recover and some of the best weapons will always be in need of ammo, you have to keep killing to refill things. This is exactly how Anthem plays out. For better or worse it's very much a wave-based arena shooter and the goal is to clear out the horde of enemies in the most effective possible way.

* This will not work if the combat is bland. Here the keyword is **flexibility**. Anthem combines the combat style of *all* of the recent Bioware games; you often get the callbacks to rogues and mages in Dragon Age, Vanguard in Mass Effect, etc. And all of these styles work while being widely different from each other. The guns themselves may come off as weak as was the case in Mass Effect games, but the combination of all other abilities and gadgets makes it very engaging, especially when your party is comprised of different classes and styles.

* After the first mission I immediately realized why Bioware went with this mission for the demo. I was initially not sold on the ""our world, your story"" initiative, but if the demo is any indication, Bioware seems to have some ideas to make it fun. &gt;!The 3 confused Dominion enemies in the combat leading to the cloned Matthias with 3 different persona in the story hub was a nice touch IMO, not to mention the subtle jokes about how to call Matthias...es after the incident.!&lt; It all feels playful while not going for entirely in-your-face jokes. I have high hopes that the storytelling will be way better than existing options.

* A friend told me after the alpha test that the map *feels* big. Now I know why. The planar size may not be that big, but due to  how vertical and detailed it is, it was very difficult to fully digest what the world looks like. So on one hand I would definitely like a custom waypoint system, since it's rather easy to get lost. But overall it's a great design.

* Jetpack does not play like I expected. I think everybody would agree on this one. It does not feel like controlling a *character*, but rather a *machine*, sort of like how you control fighters in arcade flight sims. Once you accept this however, it feels special. It's weighty while feeling precise enough at the same time. But it definitely wouldn't translate well to KB/M, which IMO is the reason why people hate KB/M control on PC. Not sure if it will ever get solved.

Overall, an unmistakably Bioware game while being system-based rather than narrative-based. After ditching D&amp;D rules Bioware has long struggled to make a system of its own, which was rather successful with Mass Effect while not so with Dragon Age. Anthem goes full systems-based using Mass Effect 3 as a foundation, and it feels good.

At the end of the day, I believe that transparency is key.  Any reviewer should be upfront about how much of the game they played, and previous experience with these games, if any.  ""Hey guys, I never played a flight sim before, but I'm giving Ace Combat 7 a fair shot.  Here's what my experience was like.""

It's not like learning flight sims, where you need to start by actually playing the game first, and then seeing how the game eases you into it.  The only way the novice could review the Japanese novel would be if they wrote the review from that perspective.  They can either say ""this isn't a good book to read if you're learning Japanese"" or ""this book has helped my Japanese immensely and I recommend it if you're still learning.""    

I'm not arguing that reviewers who have no clue AND make no effort to learn are worth listening to, as per your guitar analogy.  You're taking my argument to the extreme.

**Crusader: No Remorse**. 

Picked it up long ago from Origin's On The House promotion, and it seems to be okay at the start. It's a bit awkward with the aiming, as such I'm playing one tick below the hardest difficulty. 

Also discovered an odd interaction between DosBox and Google Chrome - as soon as I switch to Chrome, sound from Dosbox gets muted. Can't find out why on a quick glance. 

**X-COM: Interceptor**.

Not one of the popular games in the series, likely because it seems a little less strategic. The prior games in the series had the aliens seem to do a covert style invasion, where they try to undermine X-Com's support, while Interceptor seems to be more of a straight-up combat. The covert method of aliens isn't required (e.g. XCOM 2 does well with it's own way of pressuring the player), but it's strongly recommended. 

The space flight also feels like it needs a bit to get used to. It feels slightly different from the other major spaceflight games, and there wasn't much of an in-game tutorial to get players used to the system. 

Currently experiencing choppy frame rate with that game as well. It seems to be wanting the full framerate, but occasionally stutters.

3601,309,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3602,310,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

3604,312,Eurehetemec,"&gt; 90s and early 00s immersive sims are, imo, some of the best games ever made.

I dunno. I played immersive sims since there were immersive sims. I played UU, but long before that I played stuff like Mercenary/Damocles, which certainly edging towards being an immersive sim, and I loved them. UU and SS are some of my favourite games ever and DE and Thief were not far off.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)

But I think it's easy to get swept up in nostalgia. I don't think that a remake that essentially keeps the game the same, without really improving/changing the gameplay, without really adding depth and complexity to them, would necessarily be terribly compelling. I've replayed DE, and whilst it's cool, the gameplay is pretty awful and simplistic - we have tons of games which do the same general sort of thing, but in a more compelling way, and the plot, whilst cool, feels rather dated and even a bit silly. This actually impacted DE:HR, because the ""illuminati conspiracy"" angle of the plot there was by far the weakest plot element in it, and it would have been better off without it. It seemed a lot more compelling in 2000.

Thief, likewise, if you just did a remake like this, which is a fairly straight remake, and didn't add a ton to it, would seem fairly lightweight and simplistic. Not awful, but people would compare it mildly unfavourably to modern immersive sims. Obviously you don't want to go too far and make it some heavily-scripted bore like the more recent Thief game (which people have mercifully forgotten), but I think you'd want to be looking at smarter AI, possibly more complex tools/equipment, maybe abilities (but the tools/equipment could probably cover that), more complex levels and situations, possibly even more complex goals for the levels.",1548030973,1,1548027373.0,The Sims,0.9997694

People are wary of subscription services and EA has spent decades teaching this game's core userbase to pay large amounts for small amounts of content (vs. their value/dollar when buying other game software), so I think this would be a mistake that cost them money. Additionally, they have already released a ton of content to their audience as DLC and the people who are interested have already purchased it. If they want to make more money and grow their audience, they should create a software bundle that includes the complete The Sims 4 experience and sell it for $60. Then they could start work on The Sims 5 and if they create an online component (that is actually fun) and offer regular free content updates, they could consider a subscription fee in line with other MMOs.

The number of fighting game/flight sim enthusiasts is already pretty low, and then that number plops even lower in the game journalist field.  So if a big flight sim is coming out, and no one on staff plays flight sims, is it fair to ignore it?  When it comes to genres that are less explored, yes I do believe a novice perspective is important.  They can answer the question ""Is this something new players can have fun getting into?"" 

At the end of the day, I believe that transparency is key.  Any reviewer should be upfront about how much of the game they played, and previous experience with these games, if any.  ""Hey guys, I never played a flight sim before, but I'm giving Ace Combat 7 a fair shot.  Here's what my experience was like.""  I've never played a flight sim myself, so maybe it would be an interesting read for me.  If you're a veteran, then you'll probably go elsewhere for opinions.

I don't like the Japanese analogy because you don't start learning Japanese by jumping headfirst into a novel.  It's not like learning flight sims, where you need to start by actually playing the game first, and then seeing how the game eases you into it.  The only way the novice could review the Japanese novel would be if they wrote the review from that perspective.  They can either say ""this isn't a good book to read if you're learning Japanese"" or ""this book has helped my Japanese immensely and I recommend it if you're still learning.""    

I'm not arguing that reviewers who have no clue AND make no effort to learn are worth listening to, as per your guitar analogy.  You're taking my argument to the extreme.

3659,367,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3660,368,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

3662,370,Eurehetemec,"&gt; 90s and early 00s immersive sims are, imo, some of the best games ever made.

I dunno. I played immersive sims since there were immersive sims. I played UU, but long before that I played stuff like Mercenary/Damocles, which certainly edging towards being an immersive sim, and I loved them. UU and SS are some of my favourite games ever and DE and Thief were not far off.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)

But I think it's easy to get swept up in nostalgia. I don't think that a remake that essentially keeps the game the same, without really improving/changing the gameplay, without really adding depth and complexity to them, would necessarily be terribly compelling. I've replayed DE, and whilst it's cool, the gameplay is pretty awful and simplistic - we have tons of games which do the same general sort of thing, but in a more compelling way, and the plot, whilst cool, feels rather dated and even a bit silly. This actually impacted DE:HR, because the ""illuminati conspiracy"" angle of the plot there was by far the weakest plot element in it, and it would have been better off without it. It seemed a lot more compelling in 2000.

Thief, likewise, if you just did a remake like this, which is a fairly straight remake, and didn't add a ton to it, would seem fairly lightweight and simplistic. Not awful, but people would compare it mildly unfavourably to modern immersive sims. Obviously you don't want to go too far and make it some heavily-scripted bore like the more recent Thief game (which people have mercifully forgotten), but I think you'd want to be looking at smarter AI, possibly more complex tools/equipment, maybe abilities (but the tools/equipment could probably cover that), more complex levels and situations, possibly even more complex goals for the levels.",1548030973,1,1548027373.0,The Sims,0.9997694

People are wary of subscription services and EA has spent decades teaching this game's core userbase to pay large amounts for small amounts of content (vs. their value/dollar when buying other game software), so I think this would be a mistake that cost them money. Additionally, they have already released a ton of content to their audience as DLC and the people who are interested have already purchased it. If they want to make more money and grow their audience, they should create a software bundle that includes the complete The Sims 4 experience and sell it for $60.

Also expecting a base game to have as many features as the previous game + two expansions is a bit ridiculous, imagine making a game like The Sims that have 20+ expansions and then when making the sequel costumers demand to have all of these expansions represented in the base game, some expansions may get that representation buy overall it's going to be a thing that can't be done",1547484989,1,1547481389.0,The Sims,0.007148293

Maxis the same. I think SIM City 3000 was in development when EA bought them. Continued to develop. Was highly praised. Sim City 4 was developed, praised but didn't sell well.

3711,419,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3712,420,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

3714,422,Eurehetemec,"&gt; 90s and early 00s immersive sims are, imo, some of the best games ever made.

I dunno. I played immersive sims since there were immersive sims. I played UU, but long before that I played stuff like Mercenary/Damocles, which certainly edging towards being an immersive sim, and I loved them. UU and SS are some of my favourite games ever and DE and Thief were not far off.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)

But I think it's easy to get swept up in nostalgia. I don't think that a remake that essentially keeps the game the same, without really improving/changing the gameplay, without really adding depth and complexity to them, would necessarily be terribly compelling. I've replayed DE, and whilst it's cool, the gameplay is pretty awful and simplistic - we have tons of games which do the same general sort of thing, but in a more compelling way, and the plot, whilst cool, feels rather dated and even a bit silly. This actually impacted DE:HR, because the ""illuminati conspiracy"" angle of the plot there was by far the weakest plot element in it, and it would have been better off without it. It seemed a lot more compelling in 2000.

Thief, likewise, if you just did a remake like this, which is a fairly straight remake, and didn't add a ton to it, would seem fairly lightweight and simplistic. Not awful, but people would compare it mildly unfavourably to modern immersive sims. Obviously you don't want to go too far and make it some heavily-scripted bore like the more recent Thief game (which people have mercifully forgotten), but I think you'd want to be looking at smarter AI, possibly more complex tools/equipment, maybe abilities (but the tools/equipment could probably cover that), more complex levels and situations, possibly even more complex goals for the levels.",1548030973,1,1548027373.0,The Sims,0.9997694

* Factorio.  I'm terrible at this game and it frustrates me, but I do enjoy it a lot.  I have about 50 hours in it.
* Project Highrise.  Kinda the opposite of Factorio where I found it way too easy and it got stale after like 7 hours or so.
* Most recently, Frostpunk.  I'm currently working on the Fall of Winterhome campaign (Definitely harder than I thought it would be), but it's easily my favorite of the three.  I don't know if it will have legs in Endless Mode though because the book of laws and tech tree both feel too small, but the book of laws (for what it is) is probably my favorite system in the game.

I'll consider any recommendations, but I really don't vibe with the graphics/art style of older games like Roller Coaster Tycoon.

People are wary of subscription services and EA has spent decades teaching this game's core userbase to pay large amounts for small amounts of content (vs. their value/dollar when buying other game software), so I think this would be a mistake that cost them money. Additionally, they have already released a ton of content to their audience as DLC and the people who are interested have already purchased it. If they want to make more money and grow their audience, they should create a software bundle that includes the complete The Sims 4 experience and sell it for $60. Then they could start work on The Sims 5 and if they create an online component (that is actually fun) and offer regular free content updates, they could consider a subscription fee in line with other MMOs.

3759,467,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3760,468,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

I've replayed DE, and whilst it's cool, the gameplay is pretty awful and simplistic - we have tons of games which do the same general sort of thing, but in a more compelling way, and the plot, whilst cool, feels rather dated and even a bit silly. This actually impacted DE:HR, because the ""illuminati conspiracy"" angle of the plot there was by far the weakest plot element in it, and it would have been better off without it. It seemed a lot more compelling in 2000.

Thief, likewise, if you just did a remake like this, which is a fairly straight remake, and didn't add a ton to it, would seem fairly lightweight and simplistic. Not awful, but people would compare it mildly unfavourably to modern immersive sims. Obviously you don't want to go too far and make it some heavily-scripted bore like the more recent Thief game (which people have mercifully forgotten), but I think you'd want to be looking at smarter AI, possibly more complex tools/equipment, maybe abilities (but the tools/equipment could probably cover that), more complex levels and situations, possibly even more complex goals for the levels.",1548030973,1,1548027373.0,The Sims,0.9997694

People are wary of subscription services and EA has spent decades teaching this game's core userbase to pay large amounts for small amounts of content (vs. their value/dollar when buying other game software), so I think this would be a mistake that cost them money. Additionally, they have already released a ton of content to their audience as DLC and the people who are interested have already purchased it. If they want to make more money and grow their audience, they should create a software bundle that includes the complete The Sims 4 experience and sell it for $60. Then they could start work on The Sims 5 and if they create an online component (that is actually fun) and offer regular free content updates, they could consider a subscription fee in line with other MMOs.

3798,506,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3799,507,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

Take Westwood, for instance. When they were purchased by EA, they had a C&amp;C game in development. EA decided to not get involved and just told them to continue with what they were doing. This game ended up being a critical failure and contributed to their demise.

Maxis the same. I think SIM City 3000 was in development when EA bought them. Continued to develop. Was highly praised. Sim City 4 was developed, praised but didn't sell well.

Ya see, EA are a business. They want to make money. Just because a game is good doesn't necessarily mean that it is going to sell, does it?

You (and many gamers) seem to think that EA should pump money into something which is not going to make them money. EA gave these companies a chance and they couldn't make cash. Westwood would have died without EA anyway. EA gave them an opportunity to make another C&amp;C game after their previous one failed. It also failed. They would not have had that second opportunity without EA, would they?

3821,529,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room? They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3822,530,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

They are both things that must be figured out and completed before you may progress. I am sure there are many people who could beat many puzzle games that don’t have failure states easily in their first try and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have trouble finding the next room to walk to.

So do you actually think “challenge” is how we should define a game? I doubt it. It's a definition entirely created to place walking simulators as an “other”. Beyond that it holds no merit, it doesn’t help to draw any lines broad or thin.

You can make the point that walking simulators are bad games because they don’t have what you value in one, but even then they are still games. When you say that the goals of a walking simulator and a game are different you ignore the whole idea of genre. Games aren’t made good by making compelling challenges and core gameplay, many games have universally had their gameplay considered bad or mediocre but were redeemed by their story and characters. Many games, in what I would assume to be your textbook example of a game, have had great gameplay with minimal story. But when you move the pendulum back across those to the other side you get games with a great story and minimal gameplay. And they are yet again games.",1547360510,1,1547356910.0,The Sims,0.06436774
3839,547,CyraxPT,"It was a good week to finish some games that i've been playing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

 **VA-11 HALL-A**  \- Basically, a game for (slightly) bitter  people, and since i can somewhat relate to that, i enjoyed it to some  extend. Let's start with i absolutely loved about this game. The music  and sounds. Some music i just enjoyed it for what they were, good music.  Others, while still be going good, it was for that nostalgic feeling  that i got from hearing it, same applies to the sounds used. It just  gave me this vibe of the Dreamcast era.  


The gameplay, well...  It's a visual novel, so it's 95% reading, 5% making drinks. Even making  drinks is a easy process, just open the drinks menu, pick the  name/flavour/type/whatever, pick the drink and follow the recipe. The  only challenge appears when some characters ask for something non  specific or deciding if you want to give another drink than the request.  


The  story was a mixed bag. Let's put this out of the way, yes, it has the  cringe factor of the waifu/weebo stuff (no offense to those that enjoy that stuff) but i can  appreciate the criticism/parallelism made to our current society.  Focusing on the characters and their stories, well, it wasn't bad but  it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not really into slice of life stuff. I  prefer my games to be something to abstract from reality, not something  that makes me think about it.  


There's some stuff to do in new game plus but i rarely do those and i'm already satisfied with what i had.  
Mind  you, it wasn't a bad game (otherwise i wouldn't bother to finish it),  but it's one of those games that have their audience, it's just that i'm  not part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Let Them Come**  \- A really short game (2 hours) and  there's not much to say about it. Looked something braindead to play  while listening to music\* or talking, it was cheap (less than 2€ on HB  and i needed to use that amount because my HB credit was expiring next  month), so, why not.

Well, it isn't bad but isn't good either. First of all, the game has three major bugs.   


1 - Crashes;

2 - While using the charge attack, it sometimes glitches and doesn't do anything;

3  - The charge attack can be abused to easily pass the game. At max  level, half charge and there's infinite (really powerful) ammo.

I  don't regret it but i wouldn't recommend it either. There's a new game +  mode but the game balance doesn't allow it to be fun. It's just more of  the same. I'll complete it again to see if there's something different  at the end and be done with it.  


\* - Nothing  against the music of the game, it's actually good. Problem is that  there's a slow motion effect to it whenever i get to choose a bonus,  since it happens constantly, it gets really annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Prey** (PS4) - Great game. It was perfect of me because i'm a  big fan of immersive sims. My only concern with the game (and justified,  in a sense) was the enemies. It just looks so dull, even when they have  cool abilities like morphing. While i'm at it, while the music was  great (Mick Gordon, duh), i didn't liked that it reacted to the  gameplay. Sure, it works well with games like Doom, but in a game where  there's this enemy mechanic of morphing into objects to caught me off  guard, it just ruins it. What? The music changed while entering a room?  Uhm.... I wonder why...

There was a lot to do, lot's of skills to unlock, manage the resources, upgrades and so on.  


Really  enjoyed the story and the ending, although, this last one was a bit  ruined because i got the ""false"" ending from one of the side quests. A  bit of a shame that probably there won't be a sequel.  


What  i didn't like? Well, two things. There was some annoying bugs like  getting stuck on the elevator or other parts of the scenery, and doing  something before certain side missions could break it. I killed an enemy  that was in a room. Later on, i was given a mission to find a missing  person. After wasting too much time trying to find, i google the  solution, went to the place and nothing. Another google search and other  people were having the same issue. The person wasn't there because it  was previously killed.   


The other thing that i didn't like  was the loadings. I do understand how all is interconnected and how  much there is to explore in every area, but when you need to go from  point A to point B and cross 2 or 3 loading screens (if not more) with  approximately 1 minute each (and you walk for 1 or 2 minutes before  entering the area with the loading), it just breaks the immersion.  Granted, it was on the PS4 without any SSD...

Highly  recommended. Don't intend to do another run but i still have the  Mooncrash to play (but i'll save it and play something different for  now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Battlefleet Gothic: Armada** \- I probably only played 1 hour or 2. It's... hard. 

I do enjoy Warhammer games and the whole theatrical stuff going on, but i don't consider a fan to know all the lore, read the books and so on.

But yeah, i'm enjoying that part of the game, although, i feel that the story won't get too much stuff going on. Hope that i'm wrong.

Now, the gameplay is what i'm a bit disappointed about.  Like i said, the game is really hard, even on the easy setting. It's easy to get overwhelmed with what is going on and while the game explains some of the stuff, i don't think it does it particular well. I think that i'll have to see some ""let's play"" to see how some of the stuff works.

Also disappointing, for what i understood, i'll always be limited to 300 points to use when picking ships, which limits my... well, armada. Picking one of the Cruisers limits me to just an additional light cruiser. So, 2 ships? Dunno, seems too limited and way too difficult (especially for beginners like me).

3853,561,TwoBlackDots,"Games have audiovisual storytelling, but they have more in common with films than books. It doesn’t mean anything because they are games.

So what you believe separates a game from a “not a game” (I guess you would classify walking sims as books? Films?) is the incredibly subjective and nebulous term of “challenge”. Why? Why do games need to have a challenge? Because that’s what they did in the past? Why limit your definition to specifically not include a genre? All that does is limit the medium, clinging to an idea that only worked when gaming was in it's infancy and non conventional storytelling wasn’t even an idea. The idea that games need to be based around a challenge is only something anybody will give any thought to because it’s something a lot of games did before - but now they are doing it, and nothing about the term “video game” implies that. In fact it actively denies it; a video game is a video you play, walking simulators are a clear and obvious example of that.

Challenge is a word that is so weak and subjective it’s awful to form a definition on regardless. Most people can difinitavely pinpoint the win state for a game, but you don’t even have a line of what qualifies as challenging enough to be a game. Do you have to be able to lose? Then many puzzle games aren’t games. How difficult does a puzzle have to be? What separates a sliding block puzzle from the walking to another room?

We've only had two desyncs across a good 20 hours of play or so. The resync feature never works for us, but rejoining seems to do fine and is quick. The host can just pause until desynced player rejoins.  
 
We each handle our own colonists on separate maps. Time speed, research, certain mood effects (prisoner dying, etc) and other things are shared, but work priorities, selection, and other things are separate and work great for multiple players.  
  
To prepare for this for two players, I doubled the starting resources and colonists of the tribal start, added a couple of muffalo, then once I was in game, I hosted the multiplayer session and had her join, though when she joined didn't really matter. 
 
I then went to the world map screen to form a caravan, took my half of the colonists and resources, loaded up the muffalos, and moved over a couple of tiles then settled. I slaughtered the muffalo and we both began building our own bases. 
 
Aside from needing to occasionally coordinate time speed and pausing (the mod authors are apparently working on asynchronous time but it's not ready yet), it works really great. We can check each other's settlements whenever we want, we can help each other out if need be, but really we stick to our own bases and work on our own stuff, eventually trading with each other, sending colonists back and forth to help cover workload if one dies or gets sick, sharing food, etc. It's really awesome.  
  
I'd highly recommend each person settle into their own tile. You can then easily trade with your friends and help out since you're so close by, but without having too many cooks in the kitchen of everyone trying to control one base. Multiple people controlling the same base is not as fun, however it is an amazing method for teaching someone how to play Rimworld. Otherwise get everyone split onto separate nearby tiles via caravans. 
 
Some mods may cause persistent desync problems, gotta test them out yourself or just use the tested mod list as reference. Also make sure your mod load order is identical, and mod versions are identical.",1548295256,63,1548291656.0,Need for Speed,0.0020063042

His game play purpose is to add stress so that you feel like you need to GTFO, not to actually start a countdown til you need to GTFO.  When he appears the police station is starting to feel a bit safe as you should be decently armed and know you're way around.  He makes it feel dangerous again.

He peruses you like the Terminator.  If he sees you he will chase you down, but you can run from him and if you break LOS/Get enough distance he'll switch back into search mode.

Honestly, while he adds a tremendous amount of stress when he appears, he's not that hard once you figure him out as...

**1)** &gt;!The pursuing section is actually fairly short.  What makes it feel longer than it actual is is the combination of fumbling around to figure out what to do, as well as the game giving major hints that you want to finish up exploring the police station as the locale is going to change soon. !&lt;

**2)** &gt;!You can run faster than him.  If you are having problems losing him long enough to solve a puzzle, you can just lead him around the room and use your speed advantage to incrementally solve the puzzle.  If you keep your wits about you and don't panic run through the police station when he finds you, you're fine !&lt;

**3)** &gt;!I haven't fully tested or looked up any exceptions to this, but it appears he won't search for you in areas that only have one path to the lobby of the police station.  So if you go into a side room or section that doesn't have a second exit, you're safe.  I haven't observed if he'll pursue you into these areas though !&lt;

**4)** &gt;!The game is subtle about it so it's hard to notice, but it lets you know the state of Mr. X.  If he enters the room or goes into perusal mode there are audio queues.  Once you key into them you don't need to see him notice you to know if he's in search or destroy mode. !&lt;

You'll go through your entire deck fairly quickly (5-6 turns even if it's getting fat, faster with some card draw) so if you have a problem, and cards in your deck to solve it, you can handle it. 

For instance, say your problem is ""I can't do 250 damage to 2 enemies fast enough for them to not kill me"".  You can take something like Noxious Fumes or Demon Form or Limit Break that provide infinite scaling for the deck.  Then you can focus on handling their damage as your infinite scaling lets you kill them.  Maybe you take bouncing flask or Heavy Blades to speed that up and ensure you survive.  

Now say your problem is ""there's an angry red asshole with a club who is going to kill me and doesn't let me defend"".  Well you need quite a few attacks to kill this angry red asshole, so you better put them in your deck (and pronto).  Then if you run into him, you can kill him before he kills you.

3876,13,Dohi64,"**[avalon legends solitaire 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512260/)** continuing from last week. got every building around level 150 of 300, though I did a lot of replays until I got all of them to 3 stars. unlike most solitaire games, this doesn't have a 'get rid of a card or two' powerup to finish up, so it's either luck or wildcards. then I could just sell all the remaining resources to unlock the rest of the power-ups by level 170, and the rest of the money could be spent on all the wildcards and jokers I needed for the rest of the game, though I tried not to use them too much. it's also excellent that after buying the highlight playable cards one, you can still toggle it on/off. not the next card preview though. great solitaire game, one of my favorites in the genre now.

**[grotesque tactics: evil heroes:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/)** continuing from last week. I still don't like how xp is only awarded to units who actually attack or kill something, but eventually everybody got a high enough level and xp-stealing bastards weren't a huge issue either. non-regenerating mana can also be a pain since every special attack uses it, some obsession special attacks are annoying as fuck too if they happen at the wrong time, but my biggest issue was with the camera. I didn't throw up, but all that swaying back and forth between characters was really annoying. so was debuff effects darkening the screen, which weirdly can be gotten rid of by moving the camera around or reloading, but in caves the camera is even worse. in the final area I had a crash every single fucking time during the golem fight when angelina got her fucking obsession bar filled. it was optional but I still wanted to do it, so I re-did the previous one, let her loose there and managed to kill the golem.

so there are technical issues, smaller and potentially game-breaking, but I had a ton of fun otherwise. didn't even bother me that every location was used twice (one 3 times) and playing on easy was beyond easy, but that's how I like things. unless you send your vulnerable units ahead, which I did a few times, bad idea. I used a few health and mana potions towards the end, might as well, but didn't even realize until later that one of my units got wiped somewhere in the first room, visibility can be an issue, especially if you don't realize camera rotation is a thing, which I didn't until the end, and you're controlling many units, easy to get lost. also, you can see the armor you put on your dudes in-game, which is always neat. definitely recommended for turn-based fantasy rpg enthusiasts who can appreciate a funnier, 4th-wall-breaking approach that only takes about 12-15 hours.

**[grotesque tactics 2: dungeons &amp; donuts:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46570/)** started the sequel right away, of course. it's largely more of the same, but this one has wasd movement, skill trees and english voiceovers (the first only had german) and a reputation system (hate those) with 3 factions to join, so 3 different endings, 2 of which I'll just look up if I can. there's also cooking for some reason and camera is a different kind of shit this time. you could only zoom out in the first game a little, but here after a while it starts tilting, which is really annoying. you're either playing way too zoomed in and can't see shit around you, or from the top, and you still can't see shit. some ui fonts aren't very legible either.

not sure why they had to rename mandy (my favorite) to wendy and sandy to brandy (candy's name didn't change), and here's a good one: the first 2 save slots are reserved for autosaves (there was only one in the first game), can't choose them to save there manually, there are 6 other slots for that, but **quicksaving overwrites the first manual slot instead of saving to its own**, like before. basically, only use 5 slots and it should be fine, but I would've preferred a working save system, like in the first game. I tried to edit some .xml files but it didn't work and I didn't feel like installing my retail copy, they might very well be the same version anyway. oh, and it crashes every time I quit.

in the tutorial my allies blocked my way in the corridor and you can only control yourself there, so I spent an entire battle doing nothing while they got damaged a lot because they didn't fucking move. one of them was talking to me before, so he got critted from behind twice, because that's a thing now, while they took out the 2x game speed option. and while there's a difficulty setting in the menu, after the tutorial you can go 3 different ways, easy involves picking flowers and killing hippie skeletons, the middle has you collecting skulls (and killing skeletons), while hard mode pits you against a giant skelly (and some regular ones).

I went with easy, of course, but the difficulty slider didn't go up when I picked another path, so I wonder if doing the hard quest gives more xp and if it's easier on easy than on hard. the ladies did tell me making them join me was only this easy because I chose the easy path. I like this kind of reactivity in games. not so much the 'you're not getting xp for kills by people not in your party' thing, which is still around, though it's a bit different now. the game said xp is now distributed evenly among party members, but you still get points individually for hitting or killing something, that doesn't seem to be split at all, so you need to give everyone opportunities now and again, but when henchmen (npcs tagging along that aren't real party members) hit an enemy, their xp is distributed among genuine party members. weird.

the shop interface got worse as well, you can't see what you're wearing while browsing, and you can no longer buy and sell stuff for the same price, though admittedly that was a bit weird in the first game, but definitely made shopping easier instead of contemplating what to buy for hours, like I tend to do because what if I find a better one 2 minutes later. same with spending points after leveling up. and of course that's what happened, bought myself a jacket, found the same item in the same area. still, the buy/sell difference is 20%, no big deal, but I'm not sure how different loot/gear acquisition is from the first game.

3878,15,nssmuckers,"I also wanted to talk about gear for a second in SWG, because it was a fucking great system that I wish we could see more of. 

Gear was not stat based like basically every game in existence. You could loot skill tapes to put into your armor like sockets sort of, but they were definitely not essential to be competitive. 

Armor was based on resistances and encumbrances. Certain armor resisted certain damage types better than others, and the quality of the materials used to craft it determined the strength of the resistances. Encumbrances basically meant how much it lowered your HAM (you had 3 resource pools, health action mind) to wear.

Weapons had min/max damage and attack speed so DPS was a consideration, but they also had range modifiers (did more or less damage at certain ranges) and crucially HAM costs for using your abilities. 

The result of all of this is a much more strategic gearing system rather than just equipping your BIS or highest ilevel gear. 

I can give an example as a bounty hunter. I had two main weapons--a neat aside is that I basically had a dealer who made both to my specifications, and a smuggler who sliced them to my specifications. 

One was a really fast scatter pistol with low HAM costs. The other was a really slow heavy lightning cannon with massive HAM costs but as big of a high end damage as I could get. 

When I fought defensive Jedi (msaber/mdefender/4004 healer) I would always use the scatter pistol because I knew I would be in a fight of attrition and would need to have something that could put pressure on but not run my resources dry. I could outlast a lot of Jedi with my (admittedly incredibly cheese CM/BH) build and this weapon...they would need to burn holocrons because I could run them out of force. 

When I fought more aggressive Jedi like the seemingly rare ones who went mpowers, I would crack out the lightning cannon because it was more of a kill them fast or you're fucked situation. Weaker Jedi I would absolutely obliterate with this gun. 

The way these systems worked in unison with the crafting system added so much community to the game as well. Crafters could even custom name weapons to promote their brand (my scatter was Odin by Sultree and my cannon was Powerhouse by Sultree). 

The combat itself was often kind of a disaster even if it had strategic depth. CU actually did improve that one aspect of the game by taking out the ridiculous random DoT weapons, but it broke so many other things unnecessarily.

3882,19,alphabetsuperman,"It depends on the enemies. 

Because of the increased speed and mobility of enemies, most of them are harder to hit and dodge them they were in previous games. This means they can more easily punish the player for not using optimal strategies against them. That’s one of the reasons this game is harder than some previous titles. 

Because so many of them have weaknesses that rely on using special moves at very specific points in their animations, most need to be approached in a fairly specific way for optimal results, which allows for much less flexibility in fighting them. This encourages a more defensive, methodical playstyle. 

For example, here’s what official strategy guide says about the most common enemy in the game, the Gullug:

&gt;	Enemies of the Gullug variety are plentiful in SR388. They’re aggressive, their flight patterns are erratic, and countering them requires precision. Trying to defeat them without a Melee Counter is a great way to lose a lot of health. When you see a Gullug, wait patiently for the click and white circle, counter, then press the Fire button. Once it’s countered, it goes down in a shot or two, but tread lightly before then.

The guide is right. If you attack them the way you were intended to, they die quickly. If you try to fight them any other way, or dodge them, you’re going to be punished by repeated (and powerful) attacks from small, fast-moving enemies with lots of health. 

It’s not impossible to play the game outside of the way the developers intended, but it’s significantly harder than in previous titles because the game is designed around a much more structured play style, with enemies and challenges designed to strongly encourage a specific gameplay loop and punish attempts to break away from it. 

It’s still a satisfying and fun game, but it’s a dramatic change of pace from something like Zero Mission or Super which are famous for their very open ended and flexible design. ",1548451327,2,1548447727.0,Need for Speed,0.004707778

3884,21,SinntheticUCI,"Hmm, a big draw of the Tales franchise is the battle system.

Its sort of an action based system, with some rules set into stone - and most of the Tales games have different mechanics from one another. 

So there are basic attacks that are capped to a certain hit (some skills increase this) and abilities. Abilities and basic attacks is the basis of it, but it can get really interesting when you gain abilities that allow you to break these rules. In the beginning its really simple such as using 3 basic attacks into an ability - but it gets pretty creative when you learn more abilities that let you chain abilities together, or extend your basic attacks, or allow you to ability into basic attack etc. Thats a really simple explanation of it.

The passive skills system is similar to FFIX where abilities are tied to weapons and armor. So you need to keep items, and you can synthesize items together to make stronger items. And then you can equip those skills to increase certain attributes or let you break some of those combo rules.

The story is pretty generic and doesnt break any new ground, but a big draw to the game are the character interactions with one another, and the protagonist is pretty interesting.

The overworld is pretty big, and in classic JRPG style - you eventually gain an airship. The dungeons are pretty diverse and the overworld is big.

The tales franchise has a ton of replay value, and one of the best New Game+ systems in the business. Basically after every fight you are given a currency called ""grade"" that can be farmed if you want (there are ways to speed this up) and you spend grade when creating a new game +, that allows you to select SPECIFIC things that you can carry over or make the game more difficult. Like for example you can spend grade to increase the amount of exp you gain from monsters by 10x or 2x, you can carry over all your items if you want, or maybe you want a fresh start but you want to keep all the passive skills you kept, etc etc. Its a pretty cool system.

3888,25,Aegisth,"&gt;Liberty can be used but it is bringing a knife to a gun fight in almost every single situation. The biggest problem with Civ 5 is that it discourages expansions. Cities take way to long to become a worthwhile investment.

The metagame of MP isn't optimized in vanilla BNW to the point that it really matters. Most people bring a gun to the gun fight but find they left their bullets at home, so your knife is more useful. The analogy is poor, but I'm saying that Tradition is not **so** powerful that an inexperienced player can use it and consistently beat even a decent Liberty player. 

Cities do take a while to become beneficial, but that means you want to get your cities out before Turn 40 or so in the latest on Quick speed. It also depends **a lot** on your land. All of this is moot too because your land says more about what's viable than anything else.

&gt;Horses used to be a real part of the rock paper scissors of the game but they've been reduced to being around only for movespeed and taking cities. They were much better implemented before.

I mean, you said they're useless. They're not. Even in normal combat, Horses are useful because they can easily pop in, hit, and pop out on a unit quicker than the opponent can react. 

&gt;Archers are best countered by having your own archers. Even being able to play around it doesn't mean its healthy. The game is super centralized around them.

It is, I don't disagree. That's not necessarily a bad thing and it only lasts until Crossbows. After Crossbows, archery units become obsolete. 

That doesn't mean Melee units are useless. If you bring 5 Archers into my 4 Archers and a spearmen fight, I'm going to win because of the spear.

&gt;Late game is boring due to expansion sucking. There ends up being nothing to do. You can't reasonably have a lot of cities to develop. Tiles upgrades run out real quick. Roading is often not worth the investment.

You have plenty of options in the late game. But I don't know waht you consider late game, honestly. I consider it Artillery-era. Public schools and Ideaologies, but that's because vanilla BNW MP forces you to bulb Great Scientists shortly after.

&gt;No need to be condescending. If you want more in depth explanation here's a comprehensive review by someone whose played a lot more Civ than either of us.

That said, your point you can fight Mr. X showing the player has choice is a salient one, to which I'll say, imagine a playthrough, especially a first one where the player believes they should fight him and use their resources to knock him to his knees quite liberally. You know as well as I do that playthrough will not make it very far because instead of resources being saved for important situations like when multiple killable enemies impede your progress (perhaps while being chased by Mr. X) or boss fights. This playthrough will end with the player realizing they need to start over from an earlier save file and just run from Mr. X.

I'm gonna break convention and that say that is an abject failure of game design - not just an opinion on my part. Why? Because OG RE2 communicated to the player, without actually telling them, that it is your choice in how you handle Mr. X. You can down him and get resources or you can run away and he won't chase you until the next scripted encounter, employing a ""less is more"" style of atmosphere building that I feel I don't have to explain why it works in horror.

Now don't get me wrong - you are right. Despite all my misgivings it is entirely possible for Mr. X to create some really awesome moments. For example here's me (I stream btw):

https://clips.twitch.tv/RealSuaveHerbsCoolCat

This was a great moment. The tension of waiting for the right moment to run out of the room as zombies amble back and fourth on the other side of an opaque (classic zombie situation), the forward momentum of going up the stairs at full speed thinking I was safe, and then the camera pulling downward revealing X's presence. That's great. That's awesome. But here's the thing - Mr. X is entirely random. If I had never happened to go back to that item box I would have never had that moment and my experience with with X would have been even more negative. 

This ties back to I feel going with a randomized implementation of Mr. X is a step back from OG RE2 and Nemesis where there was thought put into his appearances. Instead they turned him into the floating red coins from Mario 64 that will float towards you when you active them and said, ""have fun!"" It's up the player to stumble into a thematically awesome moment with X randomly instead of the developers instead, you know, designing cool encounters.

3891,28,-Khrome-,"Warframe was made from the beginning to be soloable, with matchmaking being completely optional. None of the content requires other players, so the opt-in nature makes it a far less toxic experience because your progress does not require other players. Of course, it still happens, but not as often as it would in an environment where matchmaking for cooperative content *is* required, such as in WoW.

Here, to get through a dungeon, you *need* 4 other people. Same for a raid. The mandatory nature of the matchmaking means there's much less chance for those who use it to have a decent perspective on what other party members would want, or what their speed is. A poignant example is when you're a fresh max level tank, and want to do some normal dungeons (which are tuned to exactly that) to get some loot and experience. Others may simply want to rush through it asap, and will become irate when you dare to not aggro the entire dungeon in one go so they can speed through it. You will get kicked, and have to find another group, while those who kicked you simply view you as a replaceable part rather than another player. Same for healers or dps the group deems 'unworthy', only choosing party members which suit their specific need at the time. Or you get kicked simply because you don't speak italian (no joke).

Yet, at the same time matchmaking is still far more convenient than finding nice people to play with at your own speed, whether its fast or slow, so this situation breeds a lot of negativity due to these kind of experiences, especially since dungeons and raids do not offer any chance to do them solo until the next expansion at the earliest.

Matchmaking in this case completely trivializes the social aspect, while at the same time making what interactions *do* occur more likely to be toxic than not. ",1549285805,1,1549282205.0,Need for Speed,0.0083258245

I started just finishing the raid up, getting my gear on one class (takes about 8 weeks or so of just doing the weekly raids) then spending my time just slowing chilling out, finishing whatever side content I wanna do in the week.

I enjoy it a lot more when there isn't time pressure, and it just so happens that people will do essentially all content in this game all the time outside of older hard raids needing you to put up a party at primetime.

There's only one content in the game that has a time limit, and its PvP with a top 100 (that outside of the pvp community, and even then, most people don't really like at all). Essentially every bi-monthly post has players saying ""Wow that's kind of a cool reward, shame that I'll never see it ingame"" since its only 100 players per datacentre.

As soon as I stop keeping up with the groups and the people that are intent on getting things done at a certain speed, I just enjoy the game so much more. All the pressure is gone, we'll get it eventually, just enjoy the ride and bring friends with you, is usually how it goes.

Its honestly the way people compare themselves to the top that ruins the fun a lot of the time, people get negative in raid and mock each other in forums or discords.

What games typically have is verisimilitude: they use specific effects to give the game world an *appearance* of being real-ish.

Actual adherence to realism is generally bad, because the moment you say ""I want this game to be realistic"" you risk opening the floodgates. Injuries have to be debilitating, it's far easier for someone to be crippled or die, 'healing' items fly straight out the window unless your game literally uses  magic, etc. Sprinting has to leave you winded; the longer you sprint, the lower your top speed has to be until you get a chance to properly 'rest'. If you really try to make a game 'realistic', there's a whole laundry list of things that you'd need to add that would turn it into an un-fun experience for the vast majority of people.

3913,50,bycisnet,"Communication IS mic chat for the vast majority of competitive video games because there are things you simply can't communicate with an in-game chat wheel. If anything a chat wheel just becomes another thing to juggle during intense gameplay moments. In a game like Apex with a big map and large amounts of downtime a ping wheel works great because the game does not constantly require 100% of your concentration while in a game like CS mic chat is the only way you are going to be communicating due to the high level of teamwork required and the reaction speed needed to keep up. 


Overwatch is another great example, the chat wheel is extreme barren and has few options for callouts. We don't need more options because then the game just turns into a clusterfuck of pings and voice lines in an already very visually busy title. Voice chat is pretty much required because the amount of teamwork needed to beat another cooperating team is massive, you could never reach that amount of synergy with just a ping wheel. In fact, verbal communication is so important in Overwatch that you can almost always predict a loss if your team is made up of mutes. Someone with a mic can still play the game but their lack of communication is going to hinder the rest of the players ability to play strategically and to their best ability.

The game is very clearly designed to be played in teams of 3.

Solo completely negates most of these systems and Duo's reduces the need to make smart tactical choices.

I also disagree with the shields point.  Yes it prolongs fights a bit, but that ends up giving you more tactical choices to make as a result.

it's the port of the mobile version (based on the overly redundant help screens full of tap this and tap that) and looks better than the original (based on media I saw earlier), but not as good as the dvd version, not sure why they didn't use that. it was based on a novel, which I didn't know, and was made by some folks from trilobyte. both **the 7th guest** and **the 11th hour** got mobile ports a while ago as well, but I don't think the digitally available pc versions got any improvements over the originals I still have in big boxes.

of course, [I ran into a bug](https://steamcommunity.com/app/593900/discussions/0/135512931360376371/). didn't want to finish the episode yet, said no, it played the intro again, I fast-forwarded it and couldn't click on anything afterwards. quit, saved, restarted, still the same. unresponsive ui was a problem at one point recently in **shadowrun dragonfall** as well, and of course I didn't back up my earlier save, I only quit for a short time, figured I'd continue soon anyway. shouldn't have saved after the ui thing but didn't want to lose progress, which I still did, so I had to re-do the whole thing from the last backup I had. motherfucker...

I fast-forwarded everything I could and you can turn off transitions, but it still took some time because you can't forward audio and I didn't want to skip anything in case it matters later, but it probably doesn't. I did get some different questions, they're picked randomly from a pool after each story bit, which makes sense on a full replay, but fucks up the current one's continuity, as they lead to longer or shorter (more/less skin) version of the same videos even if I pick the same answers when I get the same questions. then it happened again, same room, and you can only fucking save if you quit, so it's a pain to back your progress up regularly. also, on the 3rd try I only got the cut/clean/dressed version of every video in those chapters because, well, rng, I guess, I didn't pick the questions.

there are a few typos here and there, the most glaring being a your/you're mixup and 'masterbation' in a book written by a (non-existant) professional, who should definitely know how to spell words like that, and in another one about tantric sex. 'bushing up' instead of brushing up was a good one too. and I get that allison is going through stuff, but her journal looks like it was written by either a 5-year-old or a really crazy person, though the latter is not that far off, I guess. the radio show was hilarious though, and of course I watched all the clips after I was done to see what I'd missed. a few alternate lines and a bunch of alternate endings. mine was pretty cool, but the others were nice as well, there was even one I thought would happen but it didn't with my choices. it's about half an hour of extra footage, good stuff.

I was looking at other fmv stuff I'd missed as a kid available now for purchase and have **the journeyman project** trilogy wishlisted, but they have some timed elements, so I'm not sure. same with **night trap** and **the dame was loaded**, those are 'be in the right place at the right time' kinda deals and I hate those, didn't get too much out of **voyeur** way back when either (can't remember if I ever played the sequel). **double switch** is by the night trap people, never heard of it before, but it looks similar gameplay-wise.

didn't really like **under a killing moon** when it first came out, might be different now, along with the rest of the tex murphy games and **gabriel knight** (only the second is fmv and the third looked and played horribly even when it came out, glad there was a demo, but I never played much of the first either, maybe I should at some point, the second has been on my mind for decades but not so much as to play the first beforehand).

there's also **spycraft** but it doesn't seem up my alley either, but I've just wishlisted **titanic: adventure out of time**, gonna read up on it next time it's on sale. and of course there are modern games using fmv, already played **her story** and **press x to not die** and picked up **the infectious madness of doctor dekker** during the winter sale for later, plus have a few more wishlisted, waiting for better prices.

**[grotesque tactics: evil heroes:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/)** a turn-based fantasy strategy/rpg, kinda like **willy-nilly knight**, which I played a few months ago. tried it when onlive was a thing and had 30-minute trials for most games, looked good enough in a janky/cheesy way. it's supposed to take 12-15 hours (so 20+ for me), no need to bother with distributing stat points, it's done automatically, you can save anytime (though there are only 6 slots aside from one for auto and one for quicksaving) and it's linear and funny, there's even a 2x game speed option, though I'm not a fan of the art style in places, the ui is a bit too small in 1080p, should scale better, the camera's shit and there's some annoying screen flickering and combat mode activation is inconsistent too.

what makes it less than ideal are the following: fucking **xp-stealing npcs**, a'la **risen**. I expected some fuckery, so I attacked what they already weakened, but they still took out some enemies. certain mobs also fight among themselves, which is pretty cool, but also takes xp from me by the time I get to them. also, **only the person attacking or killing gets xp**, not everyone in the party, so have to let everyone have a go, which can get tedious and/or dangerous, and **no automatic healing after battle** either, unless there's a shrine nearby that also heals enemies (unlike in **two worlds**). you can heal for a small fee in town, but also get healed for free before leaving, so why?

there's a healer, only from up-close and in battle and not herself. don't think mana regenerates outside shrines, but she gets xp for healing. and **units killed in battle can't be brought back until you go back to town**, which can only be done after clearing the entire map. there's a console, so I'm not gonna reload every turn for the best result, just roll with it, and if I end up gimped (or dead) because fucking npcs don't let me kill everything or I didn't manage to level everyone equally (already an issue, my main guy does everything because he can), I'll just cheat, not gonna worry about it.

obsession is a unique mechanic. killing fills it up, then the character's special attack happens, boost, killing spree, etc. then depression follows. looting's weird too: opening chests doesn't count as an action in combat, but the loot command can be executed from further away, so it can be used to get closer or further away from enemies. inventory is shared, but in combat you can only fuck around with a character's equipment during their turn. and you can buy and sell stuff for the same price, merchants don't have much of a business sense. I've just cleared the cave near westwind, but my party is already at 7 people. fun game so far.

**[avalon legends solitaire 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512260/)** played the first about a year ago, picked up the third in the last sale (gotta love those extra bundle discounts), was still in the mood for solitare after **didgery**, so I started this. run-of-the-mill solitaire with some resource management, you need to rebuild camelot because goblins.

it's not advised to restart a hand if you don't get 3 stars because resources can be collected after every hand, so just go with it and replay levels from the map. fine with me, I hate games where you can't replay a single hand and have to retry countless times until rng and/or wildcards let you get 3 stars, and level 20 and a few others took several dozen tries, didn't want to spend 400 gold on a joker, so I kept trying and only used a few wildcards.

quitting the game is only possible while playing a level, and there's a player already created with only the first letter in upper-case, but you can only create new players with full caps, and it doesn't matter anyway, the game still calls you mallard. and one of the dudes [told me off](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1622923938) for building a magic tower for power-ups instead of providing more food and such. you hired a druid with a deck of magic cards to help you out, what did you expect? there's a metric fuckton of levels (300, to be exact), so it'll keep me busy for a while. or about a week if I don't feel like doing much else.

3924,61,diglyd,"**Need For Speed 2015** \- Much better then I thought it would be. It feels like Most Wanted and the graphics are very NFS underground 2 with wet, slick night city driving. The cars feel fast, and the customization is pretty sweet. The story is corny with a ton of fist bumping but this is one of the reasons why I loved all the NFS games.  I am really enjoying this one. Also, the soundtrack is pretty good. 

Need for Speed Payback: After picking up NFS 2015 I decided to give Payback a shot. This game should not be called NFS but ""Fast and Furious Nevada land Desert Adventure."" This game really infuriated me. First of all the first 40+ minutes is basically a single player scripted story of how you get screwed out of a heist and have to then work as a valet at a casino for the dude that hired you. Only after a few scripted races and all that bs does the game open up into an open world game.  The graphics are pretty but I feel like a downgrade from NFS 2015. Maybe not a downgrade but they look different. The open world is very small but dense and I am not a fan of the Nevada / Arizona Land and Fake Las Vegas Desert setting. While NFS 2015 felt like old school NFS street racing Payback feels more like demolition derby as you are fighting against ""the company"" and they send black SUV goons after you constantly to push you off the road. I got flashbacks from playing NFS the Run and that was shit. 

The worst thing is that every single time something interesting is about to happen during a race the game yanks control from you and instead puts in a cutscene. So, in the end, you are just doing the most mundane stuff during a race and then watching a scripted event. Its like EA decided that it would be great if every time you got excited they would take the reward away from you. 

I would say the best NFS games are still

1. Most Wanted - X360 (because the cops were the best here, the blacklist, the ahole bad guy, and the open world). 
2. NFS Hot Pursuit 2010
3. NFS Underground 2 (best old school street racing feel). 
4. NFS Carbon (they dumbed down the cops here but the game was still sweet). 
5. NFS 2015
6. NFS Rivals / NFS Payback

Payback isn't terrible. The open world is fun, the graphics and diversity of locations is nice (although I would love to see some trains go by and a dam or something), the various different types of races are cool, and the car variety is nice but the game has way too many off-road events, the cars are way to hard to handle unless you use a drift car, it feels like demolition derby most of the time, and the whole wannabe Forza Horizon + Fast and Furious heist crew really turned me off to the game. 

**Destiny 2** \- Finally finished the story and got to level 29. Really enjoying the game but I was really disappointed with how the story ended. I really liked the Consul (Ghaul's friend and father figure) and hoped to fight him as a boss at some point. Dude was cool and the way Bungie dealt with him was weak and anticlimactic. Same goes for Ghaul. They were both actually cool and interesting characters and they got killed off pretty quick. What a shame. That is some really poor writing there Bungie. 

Also once you finish the story the game opens up and you can do all this other stuff which most of is not explained and the descriptions of how upgrades work or where you get what are vague. 

Still, the game is a blast to play. I've got more playtime and value out of this game than any other game in the last few years. Last game that sucked me in this deep was Mass Effect series (not counting Guildwars 2). I am looking forward to diving into Forsaken. 

If anyone plays Destiny I have a question. If I have an exotic weapon and lets say I got it when I was like level 17 and now I am lvl 30 and the weapon was like power level 150 and now I can reclaim it and it will be like power level 250 is it better to do that or do I just upgrade the weapon using a higher level weapon and upgrade components (shards, cores etc) or do I reclaim the weapon and then upgrade it? This is kind of confusing. What's the point of upgrading a weapon when you can just reclaim it every few levels and get better stats? Also, where do you get enhancement cores?

3925,62,Dr_Wankstaff,"For me it would be a tie between Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 3 from 1998 or Driver from 1999.

NFS at that time had amazing graphics and the cops were aggressive and smart.  They would try pit maneuvers, push you into spike strips or box you in if they could get multiple vehicles on you.  You could also play every track during the night and day and I remember the lighting effects were amazing.

Driver had the open world and amazing physics that would cause awesome crashes.  It was also set in San Francisco so it was very hilly and had jumps everywhere.  It also had an awesome replay system that allowed you to set camera views and freely place cameras to create something like a movie.",1548082596,1,1548078996.0,Need for Speed,0.9973354
3926,63,CBSh61340,"Again, that's why d20 and most similar systems are ""per day.""  You can rest twice in a day but you only recover spells and other similar abilities once.  Clerics often receive their spells at a specific time of day, related to which deity they follow.  Shamans and Witches might need to commune with their spirit or patron (which may be related to time of day), etc.

The only real solution to this problem as it exists in CRPGs is to make the game actually sensitive to the amount of in-game time spent.  You have a week to go and get the thing to bring it back to the guy that needs it to save his mom or something.  It takes 2 days to travel to and from... so you have 3 days to get the thing and return.  If you rest to recover spells and abilities, that makes you stronger for the time ahead but it's using up your limited amount of time.  Maybe you can find a thing while adventuring that will speed up your return trip... but maybe it comes at the cost of *not* getting the shiny sword or saving the imprisoned orphans being used to fuel the evil magical whatever.  Maybe you try to skate by, not resting because you don't want to use up that time, but then you sustain injuries that will slow your return trip.

Either way, if you take too long the guy's mom dies and you get nothing for your efforts - and, in fact, you might even face criticism and accusations from townspeople when they find out how badly you fucked up.

I mean... since when has time *not* been a factor in tabletop campaigns?  Making things time-sensitive is one of *the* simplest and most effective ways to make the players feel pressure to accomplish objectives, and a world that **doesn't** enter stasis when the player characters aren't around to witness things feels far more realistic and ""lived in"" than one where things *only* happen when they're around.  This will mean players miss out on quests and stories during a single playthrough... so playthroughs should probably be a little less absurdly long (like 10-15 hours instead of 40 hours), with the expectation that players will have to play through the game multiple times to see everything.

This would probably be a bad thing for a mainstream audience game, but CRPGs are niche products to begin with.

&gt;Well, it was a huge improvement over PoE1 in every way and not much competition in genre

Not really.  Pillars has vastly superior combat after all of the patches it's received.  Deadfire was several huge steps backwards in most areas.  Deadfire's only real improvements over post-patches Pillars are technical in nature.  Pillars, at least, regularly threw enemies with powerful effects at you because they knew every Priest had access to every spell.  Deadfire doesn't really do this because they can't be sure you'll have the right Prayer Against This Particular Type of Bullshit spell available... and even if you do, a low level buff suppresses a high level affliction so why even bother caring about any of that shit to begin with?

Pillars, even after patches, did not have the most tactical or deep of combat systems but Deadfire's is somehow even more shallow than Pillars' was.  It's the main reason I couldn't even finish the fucking game - it was *that* bad.  In a game whose primary focus is combat, you better fucking make sure your combat isn't complete shit... but Obsidian inexplicably failed at that task.  Tower of Time was made by some dudes in a shed and provided far deeper and more tactical combat than Deadfire did.",1548261841,1,1548258241.0,Need for Speed,0.015688429

And then Bioware comes out with a heavily scripted trailer of a game that seems to be a Destiny clone in both story and gameplay, promising free DLC and no loot boxes?

In something like WOW, once you level out of the early dungeons you'll never have a reason to go back to them. Of course, in practice players generally play the game in the most efficient way possible, which means certain missions will get played a lot more than other missions.

For example, Hydron is the player favorite for leveling up gear. Players can level up gear anywhere, but Hydron is the fastest and easiest place to do it.

They did run into an issue with too many rewards. Since rewards drop from a pool, if the pool gets too big then it can be very difficult to get what you want. There's a void missions that drop 1 of 17 different relics. Even if they all have the same chance to drop, you still need to run the mission a minimum of 17 times to get every relic.

3937,74,lenaro,"I think it's a good game with some big flaws. Mainly, the game-feel gets a ***lot*** worse the further you get into the game.

Obviously, moderate spoilers ahead.

There are three big reasons the gameplay gets worse:

1 - You cannot use the Seamoth below the Lost River. The Seamoth is the most fun vehicle with the fastest and most responsive gameplay, but its maximum depth means you're forced to use the Prawn and Cyclops. The Prawn and Cyclops just blow from a gameplay standpoint. The Cyclops is really cool, but it’s so big and slow and clunky to steer that it’s really tedious to use. The Prawn just sucks in general.

2 – All the lategame locations are caves within caves within caves. (For instance, Blood Kelp Trench -&gt; Lost River -&gt; Descend past Tree Cove -&gt; Inactive Lava Zone -&gt; Active Lava Zone.) This accentuates the problems with the Cyclops and Prawn, because you have to drive the Cyclops through these caves all the way down, and you can’t even bring your Seamoth with you in case you want to head back to the surface after setting up a little base in the Lost River. This also really undermines the game’s thalassophobia feel, because often you can either see the entire cave you’re in, or you’re just walking along on the ground so you don’t need to worry about the ocean beneath you.

3 – The inventory system is pretty clunky and it’s really the most noticeable in the late game when you have lots of resources to manage, and building complex structures or upgrades becomes really annoying.


So… I would make some changes to the game.

For one thing, I’d add one extra submersible. It would have all the capabilities of the *current* Seamoth, including its maximum depth limit. This submersible would be obtained from a mid-to-late wreck, perhaps in the Dunes or Bulb Zone. I would then nerf the original Seamoth, by reducing its maximum speed a bit and reducing its maneuverability substantially. Why? Because the Seamoth is simply far too good to be obtained in the first couple of hours of the game. I would make it less powerful and useful -- to make upgrading it feel really nice. I know this is probably controversial, but think of it this way: you don’t get wings in Terraria right at the start. They’re a huge upgrade in the mid-game and it’s incredible. Subnautica gives you the Seamoth upgrade when you’ve barely gotten used to the Seaglide.

Next, I would change the Cyclops. It should be at least as fast as the current Seamoth, but I would argue it should be 15-20% faster than the Seamoth at standard speed. Why? Because it’s so clunky to move around in caves that it needs something to compensate for that. Also, I think making the cameras part of the HUD would help quite a bit in improving awareness of the surrounding area. 

(This is an unreasonable change, but I also think the Lost River should be quite a lot wider and taller, because it’s a huge pain in the ass to drive around in.)

I would also change the Prawn suit. I would add backwards-firing thrusters on a dedicated hotkey, to make moving around much quicker. It’s stupid as hell that you need to use the grapple arm to have any decent speed. The Prawn is a big reason the lategame of Subnautica feels really miserable.

But the Prawn also needs some other perks to make it feel really good. I would increase its base walking speed by around 30%, and upgrade the baseline jump jets to around half the power the jump jets module adds. 

Most importantly, I think, I would upgrade the Prawn’s external lights to light up the area around its feet and light up an entire 360-degree view, as well as make them about as bright as the Cyclops. It really sucks that you can’t even see a resource that’s right at your feet. I think every vehicle should have its own area where it excels, and being able to see everything around you would be a good perk for the Prawn. Perhaps it should have a sonar module as well.

I would also make a couple of other changes. 

I’ve been playing with a map mod and it really improves how the game feels. I’d add a map module (which fills in as you explore) for the Seamoth and Cyclops, obtained from the Aurora wreck. Perhaps you could take a Hollow Knight approach with this, and add data downloads to each biome that allow you to map that area. That would be cool.

Also, the auto-sorter mod is extremely useful. It basically turns the storage of the game into something like Terraria’s auto-sort button. There’s no reason that shouldn’t be baseline.

The hotbar needs more slots. No reason this shouldn’t be baseline. The hotbar system in general is kinda… awkward. 

Seaglide map and light should be on different buttons. There’s a mod for this (Seaglide Map Controls) and it really helps.

Can’t really think of much else right now.

3938,75,Dataforge,"&gt; For sure it can be done, but is it fun to basically fly through nothing?

It could be. Have you ever played Silent Hunter? Submarine controls can be fun and interesting without having to worry about colliding into things.

For one, I almost never used silent running, or even lowered my speed. That's because I almost never took my Cyclops anywhere other than the Lost River, and the caves below it. When you encounter one of the few leviathans in the cave, you can't really sneak past them. So I just turned on my shields, and kept pushing forward until they stopped bothering me. I never really bothered with torpedoes either, not that they really did anything anyway.

If I had a need to take the Cyclops out to the open ocean, where the full sized reapers and ghost leviathans are, that would have been way more tense. Imagine running silent, while watching a reaper swim by, hoping he doesn't see you, hoping that the roar you hear in the distance gets fainter and fainter. If torpedoes were more effective, you could use them to get out of a tricky situation if a leviathan spots you.

3939,76,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Need for Speed,0.04236541

You can also click the ""sneak"" button on the lower right of the screen and sneak around and steal things to make a buck.

Once you get to around 30-40 athletics and you can run around 20-25 mph, you'll be able to outrun *most* threats you come across provided your legs are healthy (except for long necked dinosaur looking things, yikes). This will let you pick and choose your engagements rather than being ambushed.

This'll also allow you to bait big packs of bandits from the middle of nowhere into chasing you all the way into cities, where you can start big battles between them and the guards, that you can then join in on so you're not in danger of dying alone and helpless.

If you run around while heavily encumbered, you'll level your strength stat instead which helps your carry weight, unarmed fighting, and fighting with large weapons.

That said, I would be interested in what you would consider more complex - I can certainly think of some things, but they're generally going to be several hour ordeals like Twilight Imperium. 

The reason mtg is complex is *because* of those interactions you wave away, as well as hidden information and instant speed answers. Things like Duress, Thoughtseize or other ""I get to look at your hand cards"" are powerful *because* it takes away that hidden information. Powerful enough, that a T1 probe caused someone to scoop game1 during a tournament because they had a bad start and playing out the game was low%, better save information for game2 so the opponent has no idea what to sideboard. 

Slamming down things into control willy nilly is asking to lose, you need to bait out answers to establish board state. Combat math can quickly become a headache in some metas, the midgame of almost *any* matchup that isn't just one side getting fucked is much harder then you give credit for, and I don't know how you can look at any matchup in Vintage or Legacy (Ok, outside of Belcher and a few other 'do you have the answer?' decks) and call it simple. 

When it generally accepted that the game is complex, and all you say ""no it isn't, you just either draw a land or die"" people are going to expect you to elaborate, because the default is it's complex. So far you have not done so.

I'm not going to defend the mana system like some other people, though I will say it does add some interesting cases due to utility lands and interactions with things like Knight of the Reliquary - I still would personally prefer something like Force of Will's mana system over it.

The point of mentioning fire rate is to explain how each variation plays pretty differently. I don't personally use scout rifles so I can't comment but for Pulse rifles, hand cannons, snipers, shotguns etc each different archtype absolutely does not ""play exactly the same"".

&gt;There are dozens of options...look at some of the affixes you can get on armor in the Division, or a game like Path of Exile. Even a game like Assassin's Creed Odyssey has a deeper loot system, letting you get bonuses to different damage types, bonus health, bonus armor, increased crouch speed for stealth builds, increased duration of debuffs on enemies, increased headshot damage, bonus damage with certain attack types, chance to dodge damage completely etc.

3944,81,DaHolk,"&gt;I said “in part”, you might’ve glossed over that.

And my argument is still that you are putting the cart before the horse. I believe 5th edition exists because of the board game revival, not the other way around.

&gt;but as we know from a mile long list of Kickstarter failures

In the boardgame sector?
My argument was that self publishing before was still something rather rare, because it still required the same amount of guesswork of what might work or not, and how big an audience would be there.
And especially Kickstarter very quickly became a place in the boardgame space that allowed a tailored approach to manufacturing, you know exactly how many units you need to create and ship for the first run. So it enables individuals to propose a full game design with proposed assets, and can be a lot more precise with what productionvalue you can afford as a result.

&gt;making it so consumers are seeing what would otherwise be in a folder in some investors pigeonhole

Which clearly in your opinion has no influence on people BUYING them apparently. like, What?

&gt;I really think this is all less about Kickstarter &amp; more about the tabletop resurgence.

And my argument is that the availability of a vastly bigger and diverse range of options is a huge part of why the resurgence increased in speed. And Kickstarter is a huge part in getting from ""I made this game system, anyone actually interested"" to ""people are playing my game"" much more reliantly.

And secondly I don't really get what kind of ""dipp"" you are talking about if you are putting 5th edition D&amp;D as one of the causes for resurgence, rather than as profiting FROM it.

Simplified Information for me would mostly be helpful in terms of breaking down tasks. My disability makes planning steps within an overall goal very difficult.

Navigational aids are nice, but I don't necessarily need literal arrows on the ground. Minimaps and compasses are particularly helpful. Something else that I really like is queues for finding things in the environment, because it's easy for me to miss things even without significant clutter (thank you, Monster Hunter: World, for the scoutflies).

Tutorials and practice modes aren't very helpful for me, although I do enjoy 'practice' modes where it's me vs. bots. Context-sensitive tooltips are a godsend.

Pause and Game Speed - games that let you plan and execute things from a pause state are really good for me (I really liked the way the Mass Effect trilogy played it). There's a reason I play a lot of strategy games. Never encountered a game that lets you turn down the speed, but I think I might enjoy that.

Manual saving, *please*. It's not so much so I can reload as much as I want as it lets me put down and pick back up the game at will. That's important to me.

Difficulty modes, the idea of being able to alter specific elements of difficulty is nice. Especially if it lets me play with the AI unshackled but me still having some advantage.

It depends on where the players want the meta of the game to lie. I'm sure there are people who hate the pinging in R6:S, too, but the backlash when it was added to PUBG was pretty huge. The game became far less about spotting actual players and gathering intel, and was a farcry from what the meta was before the feature was tested.

If implemented, it would have also shifted gameplay and upset weapon balance. Teams would have a much more difficult time advancing stealthily, and engagement ranges would shift in favor of distance.

3960,97,PurelyOriginal,"I'm not sure what fighting games you're playing, but in MKX (what the original comment was referring to) there are literal pre-baked combo strings. If you need speed and precision to hit Y, X, Y, Down, Back, X in sequential order, then I'm curious as to what video games you primarily play, because that's way easier than say, Monster Hunter, Tinertia, or Wizard of Legend. You can 100% pick up a fighting game within a day, especially if you have someone who you can ask questions. You're obviously not going to be whopping on the hardest AI or winning any tournaments, but you can at least play the game. I'm not trying to say that it's super easy, but I think you're really over-selling the difficulty of learning almost any fighting games. 

Like, sure, Street Fighter 4 is fucky with the way links work, but a lot of fighting games have combo strings that genuinely just go Light Punch -&gt; Medium Punch -&gt; Heavy Punch -&gt; Special Attack (DBFZ, MBAACC, UNIBEL, Skullgirls). Speed and precision for basic combos in most games is non-existent as they're pressing simple button in sequential order. Not only that, but you don't even have to do combos to do well. As long as you block attacks and punish with even a basic move you'll win. There are plenty of videos of people going online in fighting games and doing really basic stuff to showcase the efficacy of solid fundamentals. I'll link to some videos below, but on series that came to mind was Sajam, an FGC commentator, did a series where he used basic techinques to climb the Killer Instinct ranked ladder a couple years ago.  

Lastly, I'd just like to say that I think people do themselves a disservice if they have no background knowledge and try and get into a fighting game by turning it around and messing around in the lab. Nobody is going to turn on Crusader King's 2 and then try and reform the Holy Roman Empire without looking up a tutorial. You're not going into Ranked matches on League or Dota without understanding the rules of the game(unless you're my teammates xddd). Understanding the underlying principles of how things like special canceling works makes the execution much easier. It's just that fighting games often do a poor job of explaining why or how something works instead of just how you do it. It's just that there's a physical component to playing fighting games and unless you have somewhere there to cradle you from behind while you hold the metaphorical clay you have to do it all yourself and that can be tough, because you can be going in the wrong direction without knowing it.

Here are some videos to demonstrate what I'm talking about:

[M. Bison Standing Roundhouse - The Movie - ""Why use combos when you can kick people in the face""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBQ5AS1kqBM)

[Ster's SC6 Basics Video - ""How I learned to stop worrying and love the X, X combo""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ojcJeA5Dow)

[Beginner Combo Guide for D'Vorah - ""You can do 1/5th of the opponents health with pre-baked combo followed by an uppercut""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x0U9DL0ZV8)

It's possible that I've been playing fighting games for so long that I forgot what it's like to be entirely new to them, but I think you're seriously overestimating the difficulty of inputting the commands and underestimating how incredibly long 2 hours of practice is. If in 2 hours you literally cannot do Y, X, Y, Down, Back, X, then the issue isn't that the game is too hard, it's that there's a disconnect between what you're doing wrong and what you're doing to fix it. Hell, there's a corner combo in MKX with Raiden where the beginning of it is just ""&lt;- + Y, &lt;- + Y, &lt;- + Y, &lt;- + Y"" it's pressing the same button 4 times in a row and you take over 20% of their lifebar. How is that speed or precision? 

I don't mean to go all in on you. I realize I'm kinda coming from the position of ""oh I already know everything just do the right thing it's easy"" but as someone who has taught professionally it's super disheartening to hear people get discouraged and then bail on the learning process because they're not doing as well as they'd like. Within the realm of academia, that's much more dire, and I realize that if somebody doesn't enjoy a fighting game then they should just play something else that they'd like. The only reason I'm bothering to rant is because I thoroughly enjoy fighting games and I feel like they get shafted because a few sweaty try-hards make it seem like you should only pick up the controller if you're looking to perspire and that's just not true. There's a ton of great character design, campy story-telling, creative choreography, and passionate communities (if you ignore all the people whining because the characters don't make their PP hard) to be found and there are all sorts of fighting games you can play from traditional stuff like Street Fighter and Tekken to conceptual fighting games like TowerFall Ascension and Lethal League: Blaze. You have anime fighters with a shit ton of air-dashing and you have injustice with a shit ton of zoning. There's Divekick, Nidhogg, that old ass Sailor Moon street fighter game, arena fighters like Xenoverse, Tenkaichi, Naruto Ninja Storm and more. In many ways I feel like fighting games are the anime of video game genres, because people on the outside have a warped understanding of what it can be due to what the really popular shit looks like.

3963,100,SleepingInADream,"Girlfriend and I have been playing this with a few other mods we like (check the mod compatibility list on Google docs, I don't have link handy). We've only had two desyncs across a good 20 hours of play or so. The resync feature never works for us, but rejoining seems to do fine and is quick. The host can just pause until desynced player rejoins.  
 
We each handle our own colonists on separate maps. Time speed, research, certain mood effects (prisoner dying, etc) and other things are shared, but work priorities, selection, and other things are separate and work great for multiple players.  
  
To prepare for this for two players, I doubled the starting resources and colonists of the tribal start, added a couple of muffalo, then once I was in game, I hosted the multiplayer session and had her join, though when she joined didn't really matter. 
 
I then went to the world map screen to form a caravan, took my half of the colonists and resources, loaded up the muffalos, and moved over a couple of tiles then settled. I slaughtered the muffalo and we both began building our own bases. 
 
Aside from needing to occasionally coordinate time speed and pausing (the mod authors are apparently working on asynchronous time but it's not ready yet), it works really great. We can check each other's settlements whenever we want, we can help each other out if need be, but really we stick to our own bases and work on our own stuff, eventually trading with each other, sending colonists back and forth to help cover workload if one dies or gets sick, sharing food, etc. It's really awesome.  
  
I'd highly recommend each person settle into their own tile. You can then easily trade with your friends and help out since you're so close by, but without having too many cooks in the kitchen of everyone trying to control one base. Multiple people controlling the same base is not as fun, however it is an amazing method for teaching someone how to play Rimworld. Otherwise get everyone split onto separate nearby tiles via caravans. 
 
Some mods may cause persistent desync problems, gotta test them out yourself or just use the tested mod list as reference. Also make sure your mod load order is identical, and mod versions are identical.",1548295256,63,1548291656.0,Need for Speed,0.0020063042

3967,104,SantiagoxDeirdre,"You're looking to add cards that solve problems.  I'd check out JoinRBS on Youtube for some exhaustingly indepth explanations, but the basic idea is simple.  You'll go through your entire deck fairly quickly (5-6 turns even if it's getting fat, faster with some card draw) so if you have a problem, and cards in your deck to solve it, you can handle it. 

For instance, say your problem is ""I can't do 250 damage to 2 enemies fast enough for them to not kill me"".  You can take something like Noxious Fumes or Demon Form or Limit Break that provide infinite scaling for the deck.  Then you can focus on handling their damage as your infinite scaling lets you kill them.  Maybe you take bouncing flask or Heavy Blades to speed that up and ensure you survive.  

Now say your problem is ""there's an angry red asshole with a club who is going to kill me and doesn't let me defend"".  Well you need quite a few attacks to kill this angry red asshole, so you better put them in your deck (and pronto).  Then if you run into him, you can kill him before he kills you.  This is where things like Glass Knife, Carnage, and Pummel are gonna shine.

3968,105,ACrazyGerman,"They'd be desynced too. The only way of preventing massive desync of time lines would be to require both tiles to start a day at the same time.

This would allow two people to play together at different speeds. Say you're going to the bathroom. You pause your base. I slow mine down to normal speed. You come back with only a few hours left in my day, but yours hasn't started. You set your speed to max, while my game gets paused at midnight until you also hit midnight.

This solution would allow for two tiles to be played at different speeds but keep the days synced. Another option would be to just have the days loop until the slowest advances to keep days aligned.

An option that wouldn't work is to keep the in game time at the slowest players speed and just speed up the other players tile. But that'd just be cranking their speeds way up.

3970,107,Dohi64,"**[avalon legends solitaire 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512260/)** continuing from last week. got every building around level 150 of 300, though I did a lot of replays until I got all of them to 3 stars. unlike most solitaire games, this doesn't have a 'get rid of a card or two' powerup to finish up, so it's either luck or wildcards. then I could just sell all the remaining resources to unlock the rest of the power-ups by level 170, and the rest of the money could be spent on all the wildcards and jokers I needed for the rest of the game, though I tried not to use them too much. it's also excellent that after buying the highlight playable cards one, you can still toggle it on/off. not the next card preview though. great solitaire game, one of my favorites in the genre now.

**[grotesque tactics: evil heroes:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/)** continuing from last week. I still don't like how xp is only awarded to units who actually attack or kill something, but eventually everybody got a high enough level and xp-stealing bastards weren't a huge issue either. non-regenerating mana can also be a pain since every special attack uses it, some obsession special attacks are annoying as fuck too if they happen at the wrong time, but my biggest issue was with the camera. I didn't throw up, but all that swaying back and forth between characters was really annoying. so was debuff effects darkening the screen, which weirdly can be gotten rid of by moving the camera around or reloading, but in caves the camera is even worse. in the final area I had a crash every single fucking time during the golem fight when angelina got her fucking obsession bar filled. it was optional but I still wanted to do it, so I re-did the previous one, let her loose there and managed to kill the golem.

so there are technical issues, smaller and potentially game-breaking, but I had a ton of fun otherwise. didn't even bother me that every location was used twice (one 3 times) and playing on easy was beyond easy, but that's how I like things. unless you send your vulnerable units ahead, which I did a few times, bad idea. I used a few health and mana potions towards the end, might as well, but didn't even realize until later that one of my units got wiped somewhere in the first room, visibility can be an issue, especially if you don't realize camera rotation is a thing, which I didn't until the end, and you're controlling many units, easy to get lost. also, you can see the armor you put on your dudes in-game, which is always neat. definitely recommended for turn-based fantasy rpg enthusiasts who can appreciate a funnier, 4th-wall-breaking approach that only takes about 12-15 hours.

**[grotesque tactics 2: dungeons &amp; donuts:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46570/)** started the sequel right away, of course. it's largely more of the same, but this one has wasd movement, skill trees and english voiceovers (the first only had german) and a reputation system (hate those) with 3 factions to join, so 3 different endings, 2 of which I'll just look up if I can. there's also cooking for some reason and camera is a different kind of shit this time. you could only zoom out in the first game a little, but here after a while it starts tilting, which is really annoying. you're either playing way too zoomed in and can't see shit around you, or from the top, and you still can't see shit. some ui fonts aren't very legible either.

not sure why they had to rename mandy (my favorite) to wendy and sandy to brandy (candy's name didn't change), and here's a good one: the first 2 save slots are reserved for autosaves (there was only one in the first game), can't choose them to save there manually, there are 6 other slots for that, but **quicksaving overwrites the first manual slot instead of saving to its own**, like before. basically, only use 5 slots and it should be fine, but I would've preferred a working save system, like in the first game. I tried to edit some .xml files but it didn't work and I didn't feel like installing my retail copy, they might very well be the same version anyway. oh, and it crashes every time I quit.

in the tutorial my allies blocked my way in the corridor and you can only control yourself there, so I spent an entire battle doing nothing while they got damaged a lot because they didn't fucking move. one of them was talking to me before, so he got critted from behind twice, because that's a thing now, while they took out the 2x game speed option. and while there's a difficulty setting in the menu, after the tutorial you can go 3 different ways, easy involves picking flowers and killing hippie skeletons, the middle has you collecting skulls (and killing skeletons), while hard mode pits you against a giant skelly (and some regular ones).

I went with easy, of course, but the difficulty slider didn't go up when I picked another path, so I wonder if doing the hard quest gives more xp and if it's easier on easy than on hard. the ladies did tell me making them join me was only this easy because I chose the easy path. I like this kind of reactivity in games. not so much the 'you're not getting xp for kills by people not in your party' thing, which is still around, though it's a bit different now. the game said xp is now distributed evenly among party members, but you still get points individually for hitting or killing something, that doesn't seem to be split at all, so you need to give everyone opportunities now and again, but when henchmen (npcs tagging along that aren't real party members) hit an enemy, their xp is distributed among genuine party members. weird.

the shop interface got worse as well, you can't see what you're wearing while browsing, and you can no longer buy and sell stuff for the same price, though admittedly that was a bit weird in the first game, but definitely made shopping easier instead of contemplating what to buy for hours, like I tend to do because what if I find a better one 2 minutes later. same with spending points after leveling up. and of course that's what happened, bought myself a jacket, found the same item in the same area. still, the buy/sell difference is 20%, no big deal, but I'm not sure how different loot/gear acquisition is from the first game.

3974,111,SinntheticUCI,"Hmm, a big draw of the Tales franchise is the battle system.

Its sort of an action based system, with some rules set into stone - and most of the Tales games have different mechanics from one another. 

So there are basic attacks that are capped to a certain hit (some skills increase this) and abilities. Abilities and basic attacks is the basis of it, but it can get really interesting when you gain abilities that allow you to break these rules. In the beginning its really simple such as using 3 basic attacks into an ability - but it gets pretty creative when you learn more abilities that let you chain abilities together, or extend your basic attacks, or allow you to ability into basic attack etc. Thats a really simple explanation of it.

The passive skills system is similar to FFIX where abilities are tied to weapons and armor. So you need to keep items, and you can synthesize items together to make stronger items. And then you can equip those skills to increase certain attributes or let you break some of those combo rules.

The story is pretty generic and doesnt break any new ground, but a big draw to the game are the character interactions with one another, and the protagonist is pretty interesting.

The overworld is pretty big, and in classic JRPG style - you eventually gain an airship. The dungeons are pretty diverse and the overworld is big.

The tales franchise has a ton of replay value, and one of the best New Game+ systems in the business. Basically after every fight you are given a currency called ""grade"" that can be farmed if you want (there are ways to speed this up) and you spend grade when creating a new game +, that allows you to select SPECIFIC things that you can carry over or make the game more difficult. Like for example you can spend grade to increase the amount of exp you gain from monsters by 10x or 2x, you can carry over all your items if you want, or maybe you want a fresh start but you want to keep all the passive skills you kept, etc etc. Its a pretty cool system.

3978,115,Aegisth,"&gt;Liberty can be used but it is bringing a knife to a gun fight in almost every single situation. The biggest problem with Civ 5 is that it discourages expansions. Cities take way to long to become a worthwhile investment.

The metagame of MP isn't optimized in vanilla BNW to the point that it really matters. Most people bring a gun to the gun fight but find they left their bullets at home, so your knife is more useful. The analogy is poor, but I'm saying that Tradition is not **so** powerful that an inexperienced player can use it and consistently beat even a decent Liberty player. 

Cities do take a while to become beneficial, but that means you want to get your cities out before Turn 40 or so in the latest on Quick speed. It also depends **a lot** on your land. All of this is moot too because your land says more about what's viable than anything else.

&gt;Horses used to be a real part of the rock paper scissors of the game but they've been reduced to being around only for movespeed and taking cities. They were much better implemented before.

I mean, you said they're useless. They're not. Even in normal combat, Horses are useful because they can easily pop in, hit, and pop out on a unit quicker than the opponent can react. 

&gt;Archers are best countered by having your own archers. Even being able to play around it doesn't mean its healthy. The game is super centralized around them.

It is, I don't disagree. That's not necessarily a bad thing and it only lasts until Crossbows. After Crossbows, archery units become obsolete. 

That doesn't mean Melee units are useless. If you bring 5 Archers into my 4 Archers and a spearmen fight, I'm going to win because of the spear.

&gt;Late game is boring due to expansion sucking. There ends up being nothing to do. You can't reasonably have a lot of cities to develop. Tiles upgrades run out real quick. Roading is often not worth the investment.

You have plenty of options in the late game. But I don't know waht you consider late game, honestly. I consider it Artillery-era. Public schools and Ideaologies, but that's because vanilla BNW MP forces you to bulb Great Scientists shortly after.

&gt;No need to be condescending. If you want more in depth explanation here's a comprehensive review by someone whose played a lot more Civ than either of us.

I'm not trying to be condescending. I'm annoyed. Your initial post shit on Civ 5 for reasons that I know aren't true, and you said with such confidence as if to say it's the way it is. Civ 5 isn't unbalanced in general and is perfectly viable to play in competitive MP.

That isn't to say it's perfect. It has **plenty** of problems, but they're not what you mentioned. The NQMod is a great example of the community acknowledging and fixing the problems of Civ 5.

3986,123,Dohi64,"**[didgery:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/429270/)** continuing from last week. it's a nice few-minutes-before-bed kinda thing and I wanted to get all the special cards and story parchments. there isn't one in every deck, so it takes a while and those 'empty' decks feel like a waste of time, but eventually I got all 40 story bits (stopped reading them after a few, didn't find the narrative very engaging). for many-many decks after that no new special cards appeared, so I stopped.

**[tender loving care:](https://www.gog.com/game/tender_loving_care)** I loooove fmv in games, but never played this growing up when similar stuff was popular (though it seems to be making a comeback), so I figured for a euro I can't really go wrong. it's basically an erotic thriller with some psychology thrown in. while **phantasmagoria 2** managed to score one of the b-movie queens of the decade in monique parent (and the fine lady playing theresa and basically nobody else ever), I didn't recognize anyone here (aside from john hurt), but eyecandy is eyecandy and the whole thing was interesting and entertaining enough. what can I say, I'm a simple man and easily amused, though there's probably not much behind the psychological stuff.

it's the port of the mobile version (based on the overly redundant help screens full of tap this and tap that) and looks better than the original (based on media I saw earlier), but not as good as the dvd version, not sure why they didn't use that. it was based on a novel, which I didn't know, and was made by some folks from trilobyte. both **the 7th guest** and **the 11th hour** got mobile ports a while ago as well, but I don't think the digitally available pc versions got any improvements over the originals I still have in big boxes.

of course, [I ran into a bug](https://steamcommunity.com/app/593900/discussions/0/135512931360376371/). didn't want to finish the episode yet, said no, it played the intro again, I fast-forwarded it and couldn't click on anything afterwards. quit, saved, restarted, still the same. unresponsive ui was a problem at one point recently in **shadowrun dragonfall** as well, and of course I didn't back up my earlier save, I only quit for a short time, figured I'd continue soon anyway. shouldn't have saved after the ui thing but didn't want to lose progress, which I still did, so I had to re-do the whole thing from the last backup I had. motherfucker...

I fast-forwarded everything I could and you can turn off transitions, but it still took some time because you can't forward audio and I didn't want to skip anything in case it matters later, but it probably doesn't. I did get some different questions, they're picked randomly from a pool after each story bit, which makes sense on a full replay, but fucks up the current one's continuity, as they lead to longer or shorter (more/less skin) version of the same videos even if I pick the same answers when I get the same questions. then it happened again, same room, and you can only fucking save if you quit, so it's a pain to back your progress up regularly. also, on the 3rd try I only got the cut/clean/dressed version of every video in those chapters because, well, rng, I guess, I didn't pick the questions.

there are a few typos here and there, the most glaring being a your/you're mixup and 'masterbation' in a book written by a (non-existant) professional, who should definitely know how to spell words like that, and in another one about tantric sex. 'bushing up' instead of brushing up was a good one too. and I get that allison is going through stuff, but her journal looks like it was written by either a 5-year-old or a really crazy person, though the latter is not that far off, I guess. the radio show was hilarious though, and of course I watched all the clips after I was done to see what I'd missed. a few alternate lines and a bunch of alternate endings. mine was pretty cool, but the others were nice as well, there was even one I thought would happen but it didn't with my choices. it's about half an hour of extra footage, good stuff.

I was looking at other fmv stuff I'd missed as a kid available now for purchase and have **the journeyman project** trilogy wishlisted, but they have some timed elements, so I'm not sure. same with **night trap** and **the dame was loaded**, those are 'be in the right place at the right time' kinda deals and I hate those, didn't get too much out of **voyeur** way back when either (can't remember if I ever played the sequel). **double switch** is by the night trap people, never heard of it before, but it looks similar gameplay-wise.

didn't really like **under a killing moon** when it first came out, might be different now, along with the rest of the tex murphy games and **gabriel knight** (only the second is fmv and the third looked and played horribly even when it came out, glad there was a demo, but I never played much of the first either, maybe I should at some point, the second has been on my mind for decades but not so much as to play the first beforehand).

there's also **spycraft** but it doesn't seem up my alley either, but I've just wishlisted **titanic: adventure out of time**, gonna read up on it next time it's on sale. and of course there are modern games using fmv, already played **her story** and **press x to not die** and picked up **the infectious madness of doctor dekker** during the winter sale for later, plus have a few more wishlisted, waiting for better prices.

**[grotesque tactics: evil heroes:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/)** a turn-based fantasy strategy/rpg, kinda like **willy-nilly knight**, which I played a few months ago. tried it when onlive was a thing and had 30-minute trials for most games, looked good enough in a janky/cheesy way. it's supposed to take 12-15 hours (so 20+ for me), no need to bother with distributing stat points, it's done automatically, you can save anytime (though there are only 6 slots aside from one for auto and one for quicksaving) and it's linear and funny, there's even a 2x game speed option, though I'm not a fan of the art style in places, the ui is a bit too small in 1080p, should scale better, the camera's shit and there's some annoying screen flickering and combat mode activation is inconsistent too.

what makes it less than ideal are the following: fucking **xp-stealing npcs**, a'la **risen**. I expected some fuckery, so I attacked what they already weakened, but they still took out some enemies. certain mobs also fight among themselves, which is pretty cool, but also takes xp from me by the time I get to them. also, **only the person attacking or killing gets xp**, not everyone in the party, so have to let everyone have a go, which can get tedious and/or dangerous, and **no automatic healing after battle** either, unless there's a shrine nearby that also heals enemies (unlike in **two worlds**). you can heal for a small fee in town, but also get healed for free before leaving, so why?

there's a healer, only from up-close and in battle and not herself. don't think mana regenerates outside shrines, but she gets xp for healing. and **units killed in battle can't be brought back until you go back to town**, which can only be done after clearing the entire map. there's a console, so I'm not gonna reload every turn for the best result, just roll with it, and if I end up gimped (or dead) because fucking npcs don't let me kill everything or I didn't manage to level everyone equally (already an issue, my main guy does everything because he can), I'll just cheat, not gonna worry about it.

obsession is a unique mechanic. killing fills it up, then the character's special attack happens, boost, killing spree, etc. then depression follows. looting's weird too: opening chests doesn't count as an action in combat, but the loot command can be executed from further away, so it can be used to get closer or further away from enemies. inventory is shared, but in combat you can only fuck around with a character's equipment during their turn. and you can buy and sell stuff for the same price, merchants don't have much of a business sense. I've just cleared the cave near westwind, but my party is already at 7 people. fun game so far.

**[avalon legends solitaire 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512260/)** played the first about a year ago, picked up the third in the last sale (gotta love those extra bundle discounts), was still in the mood for solitare after **didgery**, so I started this. run-of-the-mill solitaire with some resource management, you need to rebuild camelot because goblins.

it's not advised to restart a hand if you don't get 3 stars because resources can be collected after every hand, so just go with it and replay levels from the map. fine with me, I hate games where you can't replay a single hand and have to retry countless times until rng and/or wildcards let you get 3 stars, and level 20 and a few others took several dozen tries, didn't want to spend 400 gold on a joker, so I kept trying and only used a few wildcards.

quitting the game is only possible while playing a level, and there's a player already created with only the first letter in upper-case, but you can only create new players with full caps, and it doesn't matter anyway, the game still calls you mallard. and one of the dudes [told me off](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1622923938) for building a magic tower for power-ups instead of providing more food and such. you hired a druid with a deck of magic cards to help you out, what did you expect? there's a metric fuckton of levels (300, to be exact), so it'll keep me busy for a while. or about a week if I don't feel like doing much else.

3987,124,diglyd,"**Need For Speed 2015** \- Much better then I thought it would be. It feels like Most Wanted and the graphics are very NFS underground 2 with wet, slick night city driving. The cars feel fast, and the customization is pretty sweet. The story is corny with a ton of fist bumping but this is one of the reasons why I loved all the NFS games.  I am really enjoying this one. Also, the soundtrack is pretty good. 

Need for Speed Payback: After picking up NFS 2015 I decided to give Payback a shot. This game should not be called NFS but ""Fast and Furious Nevada land Desert Adventure."" This game really infuriated me. First of all the first 40+ minutes is basically a single player scripted story of how you get screwed out of a heist and have to then work as a valet at a casino for the dude that hired you. Only after a few scripted races and all that bs does the game open up into an open world game.  The graphics are pretty but I feel like a downgrade from NFS 2015. Maybe not a downgrade but they look different. The open world is very small but dense and I am not a fan of the Nevada / Arizona Land and Fake Las Vegas Desert setting. While NFS 2015 felt like old school NFS street racing Payback feels more like demolition derby as you are fighting against ""the company"" and they send black SUV goons after you constantly to push you off the road. I got flashbacks from playing NFS the Run and that was shit. 

The worst thing is that every single time something interesting is about to happen during a race the game yanks control from you and instead puts in a cutscene. So, in the end, you are just doing the most mundane stuff during a race and then watching a scripted event. Its like EA decided that it would be great if every time you got excited they would take the reward away from you. 

I would say the best NFS games are still

1. Most Wanted - X360 (because the cops were the best here, the blacklist, the ahole bad guy, and the open world). 
2. NFS Hot Pursuit 2010
3. NFS Underground 2 (best old school street racing feel). 
4. NFS Carbon (they dumbed down the cops here but the game was still sweet). 
5. NFS 2015
6. NFS Rivals / NFS Payback

Payback isn't terrible. The open world is fun, the graphics and diversity of locations is nice (although I would love to see some trains go by and a dam or something), the various different types of races are cool, and the car variety is nice but the game has way too many off-road events, the cars are way to hard to handle unless you use a drift car, it feels like demolition derby most of the time, and the whole wannabe Forza Horizon + Fast and Furious heist crew really turned me off to the game. 

**Destiny 2** \- Finally finished the story and got to level 29. Really enjoying the game but I was really disappointed with how the story ended. I really liked the Consul (Ghaul's friend and father figure) and hoped to fight him as a boss at some point. Dude was cool and the way Bungie dealt with him was weak and anticlimactic. Same goes for Ghaul. They were both actually cool and interesting characters and they got killed off pretty quick. What a shame. That is some really poor writing there Bungie. 

Also once you finish the story the game opens up and you can do all this other stuff which most of is not explained and the descriptions of how upgrades work or where you get what are vague. 

Still, the game is a blast to play. I've got more playtime and value out of this game than any other game in the last few years. Last game that sucked me in this deep was Mass Effect series (not counting Guildwars 2). I am looking forward to diving into Forsaken. 

If anyone plays Destiny I have a question. If I have an exotic weapon and lets say I got it when I was like level 17 and now I am lvl 30 and the weapon was like power level 150 and now I can reclaim it and it will be like power level 250 is it better to do that or do I just upgrade the weapon using a higher level weapon and upgrade components (shards, cores etc) or do I reclaim the weapon and then upgrade it? This is kind of confusing. What's the point of upgrading a weapon when you can just reclaim it every few levels and get better stats? Also, where do you get enhancement cores?

3988,125,Dr_Wankstaff,"For me it would be a tie between Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 3 from 1998 or Driver from 1999.

NFS at that time had amazing graphics and the cops were aggressive and smart.  They would try pit maneuvers, push you into spike strips or box you in if they could get multiple vehicles on you.  You could also play every track during the night and day and I remember the lighting effects were amazing.

Driver had the open world and amazing physics that would cause awesome crashes.  It was also set in San Francisco so it was very hilly and had jumps everywhere.  It also had an awesome replay system that allowed you to set camera views and freely place cameras to create something like a movie.",1548082596,1,1548078996.0,Need for Speed,0.9973354
3989,126,CBSh61340,"Again, that's why d20 and most similar systems are ""per day.""  You can rest twice in a day but you only recover spells and other similar abilities once.  Clerics often receive their spells at a specific time of day, related to which deity they follow.  Shamans and Witches might need to commune with their spirit or patron (which may be related to time of day), etc.

The only real solution to this problem as it exists in CRPGs is to make the game actually sensitive to the amount of in-game time spent.  You have a week to go and get the thing to bring it back to the guy that needs it to save his mom or something.  It takes 2 days to travel to and from... so you have 3 days to get the thing and return.  If you rest to recover spells and abilities, that makes you stronger for the time ahead but it's using up your limited amount of time.  Maybe you can find a thing while adventuring that will speed up your return trip... but maybe it comes at the cost of *not* getting the shiny sword or saving the imprisoned orphans being used to fuel the evil magical whatever.  Maybe you try to skate by, not resting because you don't want to use up that time, but then you sustain injuries that will slow your return trip.

Either way, if you take too long the guy's mom dies and you get nothing for your efforts - and, in fact, you might even face criticism and accusations from townspeople when they find out how badly you fucked up.

I mean... since when has time *not* been a factor in tabletop campaigns?  Making things time-sensitive is one of *the* simplest and most effective ways to make the players feel pressure to accomplish objectives, and a world that **doesn't** enter stasis when the player characters aren't around to witness things feels far more realistic and ""lived in"" than one where things *only* happen when they're around.  This will mean players miss out on quests and stories during a single playthrough... so playthroughs should probably be a little less absurdly long (like 10-15 hours instead of 40 hours), with the expectation that players will have to play through the game multiple times to see everything.

This would probably be a bad thing for a mainstream audience game, but CRPGs are niche products to begin with.

&gt;Well, it was a huge improvement over PoE1 in every way and not much competition in genre

Not really.  Pillars has vastly superior combat after all of the patches it's received.  Deadfire was several huge steps backwards in most areas.  Deadfire's only real improvements over post-patches Pillars are technical in nature.  Pillars, at least, regularly threw enemies with powerful effects at you because they knew every Priest had access to every spell.  Deadfire doesn't really do this because they can't be sure you'll have the right Prayer Against This Particular Type of Bullshit spell available... and even if you do, a low level buff suppresses a high level affliction so why even bother caring about any of that shit to begin with?

Pillars, even after patches, did not have the most tactical or deep of combat systems but Deadfire's is somehow even more shallow than Pillars' was.  It's the main reason I couldn't even finish the fucking game - it was *that* bad.  In a game whose primary focus is combat, you better fucking make sure your combat isn't complete shit... but Obsidian inexplicably failed at that task.  Tower of Time was made by some dudes in a shed and provided far deeper and more tactical combat than Deadfire did.",1548261841,1,1548258241.0,Need for Speed,0.015688429

3991,128,lenaro,"I think it's a good game with some big flaws. Mainly, the game-feel gets a ***lot*** worse the further you get into the game.

Obviously, moderate spoilers ahead.

There are three big reasons the gameplay gets worse:

1 - You cannot use the Seamoth below the Lost River. The Seamoth is the most fun vehicle with the fastest and most responsive gameplay, but its maximum depth means you're forced to use the Prawn and Cyclops. The Prawn and Cyclops just blow from a gameplay standpoint. The Cyclops is really cool, but it’s so big and slow and clunky to steer that it’s really tedious to use. The Prawn just sucks in general.

2 – All the lategame locations are caves within caves within caves. (For instance, Blood Kelp Trench -&gt; Lost River -&gt; Descend past Tree Cove -&gt; Inactive Lava Zone -&gt; Active Lava Zone.) This accentuates the problems with the Cyclops and Prawn, because you have to drive the Cyclops through these caves all the way down, and you can’t even bring your Seamoth with you in case you want to head back to the surface after setting up a little base in the Lost River. This also really undermines the game’s thalassophobia feel, because often you can either see the entire cave you’re in, or you’re just walking along on the ground so you don’t need to worry about the ocean beneath you.

3 – The inventory system is pretty clunky and it’s really the most noticeable in the late game when you have lots of resources to manage, and building complex structures or upgrades becomes really annoying.


So… I would make some changes to the game.

For one thing, I’d add one extra submersible. It would have all the capabilities of the *current* Seamoth, including its maximum depth limit. This submersible would be obtained from a mid-to-late wreck, perhaps in the Dunes or Bulb Zone. I would then nerf the original Seamoth, by reducing its maximum speed a bit and reducing its maneuverability substantially. Why? Because the Seamoth is simply far too good to be obtained in the first couple of hours of the game. I would make it less powerful and useful -- to make upgrading it feel really nice. I know this is probably controversial, but think of it this way: you don’t get wings in Terraria right at the start. They’re a huge upgrade in the mid-game and it’s incredible. Subnautica gives you the Seamoth upgrade when you’ve barely gotten used to the Seaglide.

Next, I would change the Cyclops. It should be at least as fast as the current Seamoth, but I would argue it should be 15-20% faster than the Seamoth at standard speed. Why? Because it’s so clunky to move around in caves that it needs something to compensate for that. Also, I think making the cameras part of the HUD would help quite a bit in improving awareness of the surrounding area. 

(This is an unreasonable change, but I also think the Lost River should be quite a lot wider and taller, because it’s a huge pain in the ass to drive around in.)

I would also change the Prawn suit. I would add backwards-firing thrusters on a dedicated hotkey, to make moving around much quicker. It’s stupid as hell that you need to use the grapple arm to have any decent speed. The Prawn is a big reason the lategame of Subnautica feels really miserable.

But the Prawn also needs some other perks to make it feel really good. I would increase its base walking speed by around 30%, and upgrade the baseline jump jets to around half the power the jump jets module adds. 

Most importantly, I think, I would upgrade the Prawn’s external lights to light up the area around its feet and light up an entire 360-degree view, as well as make them about as bright as the Cyclops. It really sucks that you can’t even see a resource that’s right at your feet. I think every vehicle should have its own area where it excels, and being able to see everything around you would be a good perk for the Prawn. Perhaps it should have a sonar module as well.

I would also make a couple of other changes. 

I’ve been playing with a map mod and it really improves how the game feels. I’d add a map module (which fills in as you explore) for the Seamoth and Cyclops, obtained from the Aurora wreck. Perhaps you could take a Hollow Knight approach with this, and add data downloads to each biome that allow you to map that area. That would be cool.

Also, the auto-sorter mod is extremely useful. It basically turns the storage of the game into something like Terraria’s auto-sort button. There’s no reason that shouldn’t be baseline.

The hotbar needs more slots. No reason this shouldn’t be baseline. The hotbar system in general is kinda… awkward. 

Seaglide map and light should be on different buttons. There’s a mod for this (Seaglide Map Controls) and it really helps.

Can’t really think of much else right now.

3992,129,Dataforge,"&gt; For sure it can be done, but is it fun to basically fly through nothing?

It could be. Have you ever played Silent Hunter? Submarine controls can be fun and interesting without having to worry about colliding into things.

For one, I almost never used silent running, or even lowered my speed. That's because I almost never took my Cyclops anywhere other than the Lost River, and the caves below it. When you encounter one of the few leviathans in the cave, you can't really sneak past them. So I just turned on my shields, and kept pushing forward until they stopped bothering me. I never really bothered with torpedoes either, not that they really did anything anyway.

If I had a need to take the Cyclops out to the open ocean, where the full sized reapers and ghost leviathans are, that would have been way more tense. Imagine running silent, while watching a reaper swim by, hoping he doesn't see you, hoping that the roar you hear in the distance gets fainter and fainter. If torpedoes were more effective, you could use them to get out of a tricky situation if a leviathan spots you. You would have to constantly stay alert, so you see the leviathans before they see you.

You would have to load up your Cyclops with resources, because there would be none in the open ocean. Maybe, if you're lucky, you'll find a few small fish you can eat. But for the most part your Cyclops and what's on it is all you have. Outside your Cyclops, it's just certain death, and that's a scary thought.",1547447179,1,1547443579.0,Need for Speed,0.9955284
3993,130,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Need for Speed,0.04236541

You can also click the ""sneak"" button on the lower right of the screen and sneak around and steal things to make a buck.

Another few important little tidbits: as you run around without being encumbered, you'll level your athletics stat. 

Once you get to around 30-40 athletics and you can run around 20-25 mph, you'll be able to outrun *most* threats you come across provided your legs are healthy (except for long necked dinosaur looking things, yikes). This will let you pick and choose your engagements rather than being ambushed.

This'll also allow you to bait big packs of bandits from the middle of nowhere into chasing you all the way into cities, where you can start big battles between them and the guards, that you can then join in on so you're not in danger of dying alone and helpless.

That said, I would be interested in what you would consider more complex - I can certainly think of some things, but they're generally going to be several hour ordeals like Twilight Imperium. 

The reason mtg is complex is *because* of those interactions you wave away, as well as hidden information and instant speed answers. Things like Duress, Thoughtseize or other ""I get to look at your hand cards"" are powerful *because* it takes away that hidden information. Powerful enough, that a T1 probe caused someone to scoop game1 during a tournament because they had a bad start and playing out the game was low%, better save information for game2 so the opponent has no idea what to sideboard. 

Slamming down things into control willy nilly is asking to lose, you need to bait out answers to establish board state. Combat math can quickly become a headache in some metas, the midgame of almost *any* matchup that isn't just one side getting fucked is much harder then you give credit for, and I don't know how you can look at any matchup in Vintage or Legacy (Ok, outside of Belcher and a few other 'do you have the answer?' decks) and call it simple. 

When it generally accepted that the game is complex, and all you say ""no it isn't, you just either draw a land or die"" people are going to expect you to elaborate, because the default is it's complex. So far you have not done so.

And my argument is still that you are putting the cart before the horse. I believe 5th edition exists because of the board game revival, not the other way around.

&gt;but as we know from a mile long list of Kickstarter failures

In the boardgame sector?
My argument was that self publishing before was still something rather rare, because it still required the same amount of guesswork of what might work or not, and how big an audience would be there.
And especially Kickstarter very quickly became a place in the boardgame space that allowed a tailored approach to manufacturing, you know exactly how many units you need to create and ship for the first run. So it enables individuals to propose a full game design with proposed assets, and can be a lot more precise with what productionvalue you can afford as a result.

&gt;making it so consumers are seeing what would otherwise be in a folder in some investors pigeonhole

Which clearly in your opinion has no influence on people BUYING them apparently. like, What?

&gt;I really think this is all less about Kickstarter &amp; more about the tabletop resurgence.

And my argument is that the availability of a vastly bigger and diverse range of options is a huge part of why the resurgence increased in speed. And Kickstarter is a huge part in getting from ""I made this game system, anyone actually interested"" to ""people are playing my game"" much more reliantly.

And secondly I don't really get what kind of ""dipp"" you are talking about if you are putting 5th edition D&amp;D as one of the causes for resurgence, rather than as profiting FROM it.

3998,135,PurelyOriginal,"I'm not sure what fighting games you're playing, but in MKX (what the original comment was referring to) there are literal pre-baked combo strings. If you need speed and precision to hit Y, X, Y, Down, Back, X in sequential order, then I'm curious as to what video games you primarily play, because that's way easier than say, Monster Hunter, Tinertia, or Wizard of Legend. You can 100% pick up a fighting game within a day, especially if you have someone who you can ask questions. You're obviously not going to be whopping on the hardest AI or winning any tournaments, but you can at least play the game. I'm not trying to say that it's super easy, but I think you're really over-selling the difficulty of learning almost any fighting games. 

Like, sure, Street Fighter 4 is fucky with the way links work, but a lot of fighting games have combo strings that genuinely just go Light Punch -&gt; Medium Punch -&gt; Heavy Punch -&gt; Special Attack (DBFZ, MBAACC, UNIBEL, Skullgirls). Speed and precision for basic combos in most games is non-existent as they're pressing simple button in sequential order. Not only that, but you don't even have to do combos to do well. As long as you block attacks and punish with even a basic move you'll win. There are plenty of videos of people going online in fighting games and doing really basic stuff to showcase the efficacy of solid fundamentals. I'll link to some videos below, but on series that came to mind was Sajam, an FGC commentator, did a series where he used basic techinques to climb the Killer Instinct ranked ladder a couple years ago.  

Lastly, I'd just like to say that I think people do themselves a disservice if they have no background knowledge and try and get into a fighting game by turning it around and messing around in the lab. Nobody is going to turn on Crusader King's 2 and then try and reform the Holy Roman Empire without looking up a tutorial. You're not going into Ranked matches on League or Dota without understanding the rules of the game(unless you're my teammates xddd). Understanding the underlying principles of how things like special canceling works makes the execution much easier. It's just that fighting games often do a poor job of explaining why or how something works instead of just how you do it. It's just that there's a physical component to playing fighting games and unless you have somewhere there to cradle you from behind while you hold the metaphorical clay you have to do it all yourself and that can be tough, because you can be going in the wrong direction without knowing it.

Here are some videos to demonstrate what I'm talking about:

[M. Bison Standing Roundhouse - The Movie - ""Why use combos when you can kick people in the face""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBQ5AS1kqBM)

[Ster's SC6 Basics Video - ""How I learned to stop worrying and love the X, X combo""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ojcJeA5Dow)

[Beginner Combo Guide for D'Vorah - ""You can do 1/5th of the opponents health with pre-baked combo followed by an uppercut""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x0U9DL0ZV8)

It's possible that I've been playing fighting games for so long that I forgot what it's like to be entirely new to them, but I think you're seriously overestimating the difficulty of inputting the commands and underestimating how incredibly long 2 hours of practice is. If in 2 hours you literally cannot do Y, X, Y, Down, Back, X, then the issue isn't that the game is too hard, it's that there's a disconnect between what you're doing wrong and what you're doing to fix it. Hell, there's a corner combo in MKX with Raiden where the beginning of it is just ""&lt;- + Y, &lt;- + Y, &lt;- + Y, &lt;- + Y"" it's pressing the same button 4 times in a row and you take over 20% of their lifebar. How is that speed or precision? 

I don't mean to go all in on you. I realize I'm kinda coming from the position of ""oh I already know everything just do the right thing it's easy"" but as someone who has taught professionally it's super disheartening to hear people get discouraged and then bail on the learning process because they're not doing as well as they'd like. Within the realm of academia, that's much more dire, and I realize that if somebody doesn't enjoy a fighting game then they should just play something else that they'd like. The only reason I'm bothering to rant is because I thoroughly enjoy fighting games and I feel like they get shafted because a few sweaty try-hards make it seem like you should only pick up the controller if you're looking to perspire and that's just not true. There's a ton of great character design, campy story-telling, creative choreography, and passionate communities (if you ignore all the people whining because the characters don't make their PP hard) to be found and there are all sorts of fighting games you can play from traditional stuff like Street Fighter and Tekken to conceptual fighting games like TowerFall Ascension and Lethal League: Blaze. You have anime fighters with a shit ton of air-dashing and you have injustice with a shit ton of zoning. There's Divekick, Nidhogg, that old ass Sailor Moon street fighter game, arena fighters like Xenoverse, Tenkaichi, Naruto Ninja Storm and more. In many ways I feel like fighting games are the anime of video game genres, because people on the outside have a warped understanding of what it can be due to what the really popular shit looks like.

4002,139,SinntheticUCI,"Hmm, a big draw of the Tales franchise is the battle system.

Its sort of an action based system, with some rules set into stone - and most of the Tales games have different mechanics from one another. 

So there are basic attacks that are capped to a certain hit (some skills increase this) and abilities. Abilities and basic attacks is the basis of it, but it can get really interesting when you gain abilities that allow you to break these rules. In the beginning its really simple such as using 3 basic attacks into an ability - but it gets pretty creative when you learn more abilities that let you chain abilities together, or extend your basic attacks, or allow you to ability into basic attack etc. Thats a really simple explanation of it.

The passive skills system is similar to FFIX where abilities are tied to weapons and armor. So you need to keep items, and you can synthesize items together to make stronger items. And then you can equip those skills to increase certain attributes or let you break some of those combo rules.

The story is pretty generic and doesnt break any new ground, but a big draw to the game are the character interactions with one another, and the protagonist is pretty interesting.

The overworld is pretty big, and in classic JRPG style - you eventually gain an airship. The dungeons are pretty diverse and the overworld is big.

The tales franchise has a ton of replay value, and one of the best New Game+ systems in the business. Basically after every fight you are given a currency called ""grade"" that can be farmed if you want (there are ways to speed this up) and you spend grade when creating a new game +, that allows you to select SPECIFIC things that you can carry over or make the game more difficult. Like for example you can spend grade to increase the amount of exp you gain from monsters by 10x or 2x, you can carry over all your items if you want, or maybe you want a fresh start but you want to keep all the passive skills you kept, etc etc. Its a pretty cool system.

4005,142,Aegisth,"&gt;Liberty can be used but it is bringing a knife to a gun fight in almost every single situation. The biggest problem with Civ 5 is that it discourages expansions. Cities take way to long to become a worthwhile investment.

The metagame of MP isn't optimized in vanilla BNW to the point that it really matters. Most people bring a gun to the gun fight but find they left their bullets at home, so your knife is more useful. The analogy is poor, but I'm saying that Tradition is not **so** powerful that an inexperienced player can use it and consistently beat even a decent Liberty player. 

Cities do take a while to become beneficial, but that means you want to get your cities out before Turn 40 or so in the latest on Quick speed. It also depends **a lot** on your land. All of this is moot too because your land says more about what's viable than anything else.

&gt;Horses used to be a real part of the rock paper scissors of the game but they've been reduced to being around only for movespeed and taking cities. They were much better implemented before.

I mean, you said they're useless. They're not. Even in normal combat, Horses are useful because they can easily pop in, hit, and pop out on a unit quicker than the opponent can react. 

&gt;Archers are best countered by having your own archers. Even being able to play around it doesn't mean its healthy. The game is super centralized around them.

It is, I don't disagree. That's not necessarily a bad thing and it only lasts until Crossbows. After Crossbows, archery units become obsolete. 

That doesn't mean Melee units are useless. If you bring 5 Archers into my 4 Archers and a spearmen fight, I'm going to win because of the spear.

&gt;Late game is boring due to expansion sucking. There ends up being nothing to do. You can't reasonably have a lot of cities to develop. Tiles upgrades run out real quick. Roading is often not worth the investment.

You have plenty of options in the late game. But I don't know waht you consider late game, honestly. I consider it Artillery-era. Public schools and Ideaologies, but that's because vanilla BNW MP forces you to bulb Great Scientists shortly after.

&gt;No need to be condescending. If you want more in depth explanation here's a comprehensive review by someone whose played a lot more Civ than either of us.

I'm not trying to be condescending. I'm annoyed. Your initial post shit on Civ 5 for reasons that I know aren't true, and you said with such confidence as if to say it's the way it is. Civ 5 isn't unbalanced in general and is perfectly viable to play in competitive MP.

That isn't to say it's perfect. It has **plenty** of problems, but they're not what you mentioned. The NQMod is a great example of the community acknowledging and fixing the problems of Civ 5.

4011,148,Dohi64,"**[didgery:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/429270/)** continuing from last week. it's a nice few-minutes-before-bed kinda thing and I wanted to get all the special cards and story parchments. there isn't one in every deck, so it takes a while and those 'empty' decks feel like a waste of time, but eventually I got all 40 story bits (stopped reading them after a few, didn't find the narrative very engaging). for many-many decks after that no new special cards appeared, so I stopped.

**[tender loving care:](https://www.gog.com/game/tender_loving_care)** I loooove fmv in games, but never played this growing up when similar stuff was popular (though it seems to be making a comeback), so I figured for a euro I can't really go wrong. it's basically an erotic thriller with some psychology thrown in. while **phantasmagoria 2** managed to score one of the b-movie queens of the decade in monique parent (and the fine lady playing theresa and basically nobody else ever), I didn't recognize anyone here (aside from john hurt), but eyecandy is eyecandy and the whole thing was interesting and entertaining enough. what can I say, I'm a simple man and easily amused, though there's probably not much behind the psychological stuff.

it's the port of the mobile version (based on the overly redundant help screens full of tap this and tap that) and looks better than the original (based on media I saw earlier), but not as good as the dvd version, not sure why they didn't use that. it was based on a novel, which I didn't know, and was made by some folks from trilobyte. both **the 7th guest** and **the 11th hour** got mobile ports a while ago as well, but I don't think the digitally available pc versions got any improvements over the originals I still have in big boxes.

of course, [I ran into a bug](https://steamcommunity.com/app/593900/discussions/0/135512931360376371/). didn't want to finish the episode yet, said no, it played the intro again, I fast-forwarded it and couldn't click on anything afterwards. quit, saved, restarted, still the same. unresponsive ui was a problem at one point recently in **shadowrun dragonfall** as well, and of course I didn't back up my earlier save, I only quit for a short time, figured I'd continue soon anyway. shouldn't have saved after the ui thing but didn't want to lose progress, which I still did, so I had to re-do the whole thing from the last backup I had. motherfucker...

I fast-forwarded everything I could and you can turn off transitions, but it still took some time because you can't forward audio and I didn't want to skip anything in case it matters later, but it probably doesn't. I did get some different questions, they're picked randomly from a pool after each story bit, which makes sense on a full replay, but fucks up the current one's continuity, as they lead to longer or shorter (more/less skin) version of the same videos even if I pick the same answers when I get the same questions. then it happened again, same room, and you can only fucking save if you quit, so it's a pain to back your progress up regularly. also, on the 3rd try I only got the cut/clean/dressed version of every video in those chapters because, well, rng, I guess, I didn't pick the questions.

there are a few typos here and there, the most glaring being a your/you're mixup and 'masterbation' in a book written by a (non-existant) professional, who should definitely know how to spell words like that, and in another one about tantric sex. 'bushing up' instead of brushing up was a good one too. and I get that allison is going through stuff, but her journal looks like it was written by either a 5-year-old or a really crazy person, though the latter is not that far off, I guess. the radio show was hilarious though, and of course I watched all the clips after I was done to see what I'd missed. a few alternate lines and a bunch of alternate endings. mine was pretty cool, but the others were nice as well, there was even one I thought would happen but it didn't with my choices. it's about half an hour of extra footage, good stuff.

I was looking at other fmv stuff I'd missed as a kid available now for purchase and have **the journeyman project** trilogy wishlisted, but they have some timed elements, so I'm not sure. same with **night trap** and **the dame was loaded**, those are 'be in the right place at the right time' kinda deals and I hate those, didn't get too much out of **voyeur** way back when either (can't remember if I ever played the sequel). **double switch** is by the night trap people, never heard of it before, but it looks similar gameplay-wise.

didn't really like **under a killing moon** when it first came out, might be different now, along with the rest of the tex murphy games and **gabriel knight** (only the second is fmv and the third looked and played horribly even when it came out, glad there was a demo, but I never played much of the first either, maybe I should at some point, the second has been on my mind for decades but not so much as to play the first beforehand).

there's also **spycraft** but it doesn't seem up my alley either, but I've just wishlisted **titanic: adventure out of time**, gonna read up on it next time it's on sale. and of course there are modern games using fmv, already played **her story** and **press x to not die** and picked up **the infectious madness of doctor dekker** during the winter sale for later, plus have a few more wishlisted, waiting for better prices.

**[grotesque tactics: evil heroes:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/)** a turn-based fantasy strategy/rpg, kinda like **willy-nilly knight**, which I played a few months ago. tried it when onlive was a thing and had 30-minute trials for most games, looked good enough in a janky/cheesy way. it's supposed to take 12-15 hours (so 20+ for me), no need to bother with distributing stat points, it's done automatically, you can save anytime (though there are only 6 slots aside from one for auto and one for quicksaving) and it's linear and funny, there's even a 2x game speed option, though I'm not a fan of the art style in places, the ui is a bit too small in 1080p, should scale better, the camera's shit and there's some annoying screen flickering and combat mode activation is inconsistent too.

what makes it less than ideal are the following: fucking **xp-stealing npcs**, a'la **risen**. I expected some fuckery, so I attacked what they already weakened, but they still took out some enemies. certain mobs also fight among themselves, which is pretty cool, but also takes xp from me by the time I get to them. also, **only the person attacking or killing gets xp**, not everyone in the party, so have to let everyone have a go, which can get tedious and/or dangerous, and **no automatic healing after battle** either, unless there's a shrine nearby that also heals enemies (unlike in **two worlds**). you can heal for a small fee in town, but also get healed for free before leaving, so why?

there's a healer, only from up-close and in battle and not herself. don't think mana regenerates outside shrines, but she gets xp for healing. and **units killed in battle can't be brought back until you go back to town**, which can only be done after clearing the entire map. there's a console, so I'm not gonna reload every turn for the best result, just roll with it, and if I end up gimped (or dead) because fucking npcs don't let me kill everything or I didn't manage to level everyone equally (already an issue, my main guy does everything because he can), I'll just cheat, not gonna worry about it.

obsession is a unique mechanic. killing fills it up, then the character's special attack happens, boost, killing spree, etc. then depression follows. looting's weird too: opening chests doesn't count as an action in combat, but the loot command can be executed from further away, so it can be used to get closer or further away from enemies. inventory is shared, but in combat you can only fuck around with a character's equipment during their turn. and you can buy and sell stuff for the same price, merchants don't have much of a business sense. I've just cleared the cave near westwind, but my party is already at 7 people. fun game so far.

**[avalon legends solitaire 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512260/)** played the first about a year ago, picked up the third in the last sale (gotta love those extra bundle discounts), was still in the mood for solitare after **didgery**, so I started this. run-of-the-mill solitaire with some resource management, you need to rebuild camelot because goblins.

it's not advised to restart a hand if you don't get 3 stars because resources can be collected after every hand, so just go with it and replay levels from the map. fine with me, I hate games where you can't replay a single hand and have to retry countless times until rng and/or wildcards let you get 3 stars, and level 20 and a few others took several dozen tries, didn't want to spend 400 gold on a joker, so I kept trying and only used a few wildcards.

quitting the game is only possible while playing a level, and there's a player already created with only the first letter in upper-case, but you can only create new players with full caps, and it doesn't matter anyway, the game still calls you mallard. and one of the dudes [told me off](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1622923938) for building a magic tower for power-ups instead of providing more food and such. you hired a druid with a deck of magic cards to help you out, what did you expect? there's a metric fuckton of levels (300, to be exact), so it'll keep me busy for a while. or about a week if I don't feel like doing much else.

4012,149,diglyd,"**Need For Speed 2015** \- Much better then I thought it would be. It feels like Most Wanted and the graphics are very NFS underground 2 with wet, slick night city driving. The cars feel fast, and the customization is pretty sweet. The story is corny with a ton of fist bumping but this is one of the reasons why I loved all the NFS games.  I am really enjoying this one. Also, the soundtrack is pretty good. 

Need for Speed Payback: After picking up NFS 2015 I decided to give Payback a shot. This game should not be called NFS but ""Fast and Furious Nevada land Desert Adventure."" This game really infuriated me. First of all the first 40+ minutes is basically a single player scripted story of how you get screwed out of a heist and have to then work as a valet at a casino for the dude that hired you. Only after a few scripted races and all that bs does the game open up into an open world game.  The graphics are pretty but I feel like a downgrade from NFS 2015. Maybe not a downgrade but they look different. The open world is very small but dense and I am not a fan of the Nevada / Arizona Land and Fake Las Vegas Desert setting. While NFS 2015 felt like old school NFS street racing Payback feels more like demolition derby as you are fighting against ""the company"" and they send black SUV goons after you constantly to push you off the road. I got flashbacks from playing NFS the Run and that was shit. 

The worst thing is that every single time something interesting is about to happen during a race the game yanks control from you and instead puts in a cutscene. So, in the end, you are just doing the most mundane stuff during a race and then watching a scripted event. Its like EA decided that it would be great if every time you got excited they would take the reward away from you. 

I would say the best NFS games are still

1. Most Wanted - X360 (because the cops were the best here, the blacklist, the ahole bad guy, and the open world). 
2. NFS Hot Pursuit 2010
3. NFS Underground 2 (best old school street racing feel). 
4. NFS Carbon (they dumbed down the cops here but the game was still sweet). 
5. NFS 2015
6. NFS Rivals / NFS Payback

Payback isn't terrible. The open world is fun, the graphics and diversity of locations is nice (although I would love to see some trains go by and a dam or something), the various different types of races are cool, and the car variety is nice but the game has way too many off-road events, the cars are way to hard to handle unless you use a drift car, it feels like demolition derby most of the time, and the whole wannabe Forza Horizon + Fast and Furious heist crew really turned me off to the game. 

**Destiny 2** \- Finally finished the story and got to level 29. Really enjoying the game but I was really disappointed with how the story ended. I really liked the Consul (Ghaul's friend and father figure) and hoped to fight him as a boss at some point. Dude was cool and the way Bungie dealt with him was weak and anticlimactic. Same goes for Ghaul. They were both actually cool and interesting characters and they got killed off pretty quick. What a shame. That is some really poor writing there Bungie. 

Also once you finish the story the game opens up and you can do all this other stuff which most of is not explained and the descriptions of how upgrades work or where you get what are vague. 

Still, the game is a blast to play. I've got more playtime and value out of this game than any other game in the last few years. Last game that sucked me in this deep was Mass Effect series (not counting Guildwars 2). I am looking forward to diving into Forsaken. 

If anyone plays Destiny I have a question. If I have an exotic weapon and lets say I got it when I was like level 17 and now I am lvl 30 and the weapon was like power level 150 and now I can reclaim it and it will be like power level 250 is it better to do that or do I just upgrade the weapon using a higher level weapon and upgrade components (shards, cores etc) or do I reclaim the weapon and then upgrade it? This is kind of confusing. What's the point of upgrading a weapon when you can just reclaim it every few levels and get better stats? Also, where do you get enhancement cores?

4014,151,lenaro,"I think it's a good game with some big flaws. Mainly, the game-feel gets a ***lot*** worse the further you get into the game.

Obviously, moderate spoilers ahead.

There are three big reasons the gameplay gets worse:

1 - You cannot use the Seamoth below the Lost River. The Seamoth is the most fun vehicle with the fastest and most responsive gameplay, but its maximum depth means you're forced to use the Prawn and Cyclops. The Prawn and Cyclops just blow from a gameplay standpoint. The Cyclops is really cool, but it’s so big and slow and clunky to steer that it’s really tedious to use. The Prawn just sucks in general.

2 – All the lategame locations are caves within caves within caves. (For instance, Blood Kelp Trench -&gt; Lost River -&gt; Descend past Tree Cove -&gt; Inactive Lava Zone -&gt; Active Lava Zone.) This accentuates the problems with the Cyclops and Prawn, because you have to drive the Cyclops through these caves all the way down, and you can’t even bring your Seamoth with you in case you want to head back to the surface after setting up a little base in the Lost River. This also really undermines the game’s thalassophobia feel, because often you can either see the entire cave you’re in, or you’re just walking along on the ground so you don’t need to worry about the ocean beneath you.

3 – The inventory system is pretty clunky and it’s really the most noticeable in the late game when you have lots of resources to manage, and building complex structures or upgrades becomes really annoying.


So… I would make some changes to the game.

For one thing, I’d add one extra submersible. It would have all the capabilities of the *current* Seamoth, including its maximum depth limit. This submersible would be obtained from a mid-to-late wreck, perhaps in the Dunes or Bulb Zone. I would then nerf the original Seamoth, by reducing its maximum speed a bit and reducing its maneuverability substantially. Why? Because the Seamoth is simply far too good to be obtained in the first couple of hours of the game. I would make it less powerful and useful -- to make upgrading it feel really nice. I know this is probably controversial, but think of it this way: you don’t get wings in Terraria right at the start. They’re a huge upgrade in the mid-game and it’s incredible. Subnautica gives you the Seamoth upgrade when you’ve barely gotten used to the Seaglide.

Next, I would change the Cyclops. It should be at least as fast as the current Seamoth, but I would argue it should be 15-20% faster than the Seamoth at standard speed. Why? Because it’s so clunky to move around in caves that it needs something to compensate for that. Also, I think making the cameras part of the HUD would help quite a bit in improving awareness of the surrounding area. 

(This is an unreasonable change, but I also think the Lost River should be quite a lot wider and taller, because it’s a huge pain in the ass to drive around in.)

I would also change the Prawn suit. I would add backwards-firing thrusters on a dedicated hotkey, to make moving around much quicker. It’s stupid as hell that you need to use the grapple arm to have any decent speed. The Prawn is a big reason the lategame of Subnautica feels really miserable.

But the Prawn also needs some other perks to make it feel really good. I would increase its base walking speed by around 30%, and upgrade the baseline jump jets to around half the power the jump jets module adds. 

Most importantly, I think, I would upgrade the Prawn’s external lights to light up the area around its feet and light up an entire 360-degree view, as well as make them about as bright as the Cyclops. It really sucks that you can’t even see a resource that’s right at your feet. I think every vehicle should have its own area where it excels, and being able to see everything around you would be a good perk for the Prawn. Perhaps it should have a sonar module as well.

I would also make a couple of other changes. 

I’ve been playing with a map mod and it really improves how the game feels. I’d add a map module (which fills in as you explore) for the Seamoth and Cyclops, obtained from the Aurora wreck. Perhaps you could take a Hollow Knight approach with this, and add data downloads to each biome that allow you to map that area. That would be cool.

Also, the auto-sorter mod is extremely useful. It basically turns the storage of the game into something like Terraria’s auto-sort button. There’s no reason that shouldn’t be baseline.

The hotbar needs more slots. No reason this shouldn’t be baseline. The hotbar system in general is kinda… awkward. 

Seaglide map and light should be on different buttons. There’s a mod for this (Seaglide Map Controls) and it really helps.

Can’t really think of much else right now.

4015,152,Dataforge,"&gt; For sure it can be done, but is it fun to basically fly through nothing?

It could be. Have you ever played Silent Hunter? Submarine controls can be fun and interesting without having to worry about colliding into things.

For one, I almost never used silent running, or even lowered my speed. That's because I almost never took my Cyclops anywhere other than the Lost River, and the caves below it. When you encounter one of the few leviathans in the cave, you can't really sneak past them. So I just turned on my shields, and kept pushing forward until they stopped bothering me. I never really bothered with torpedoes either, not that they really did anything anyway.

If I had a need to take the Cyclops out to the open ocean, where the full sized reapers and ghost leviathans are, that would have been way more tense. Imagine running silent, while watching a reaper swim by, hoping he doesn't see you, hoping that the roar you hear in the distance gets fainter and fainter. If torpedoes were more effective, you could use them to get out of a tricky situation if a leviathan spots you. You would have to constantly stay alert, so you see the leviathans before they see you.

You would have to load up your Cyclops with resources, because there would be none in the open ocean. Maybe, if you're lucky, you'll find a few small fish you can eat. But for the most part your Cyclops and what's on it is all you have. Outside your Cyclops, it's just certain death, and that's a scary thought.",1547447179,1,1547443579.0,Need for Speed,0.9955284
4016,153,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Need for Speed,0.04236541

You can also click the ""sneak"" button on the lower right of the screen and sneak around and steal things to make a buck. Sneaking by itself isn't illegal as long as you aren't trespassing, even if people see you. As long as you're moving in sneak mode around anything that can potentially see you, you'll level your sneak skill up. 

Another few important little tidbits: as you run around without being encumbered, you'll level your athletics stat. 

Once you get to around 30-40 athletics and you can run around 20-25 mph, you'll be able to outrun *most* threats you come across provided your legs are healthy (except for long necked dinosaur looking things, yikes). This will let you pick and choose your engagements rather than being ambushed.

This'll also allow you to bait big packs of bandits from the middle of nowhere into chasing you all the way into cities, where you can start big battles between them and the guards, that you can then join in on so you're not in danger of dying alone and helpless.

If you run around while heavily encumbered, you'll level your strength stat instead which helps your carry weight, unarmed fighting, and fighting with large weapons.

4018,155,Ryuujinx,"I decided to scroll through your history to see if you posted frequently about what you would call complicated to find a thread where you were playing love letter wrong, which I found hilarious. That said, I would be interested in what you would consider more complex - I can certainly think of some things, but they're generally going to be several hour ordeals like Twilight Imperium. 

The reason mtg is complex is *because* of those interactions you wave away, as well as hidden information and instant speed answers. Things like Duress, Thoughtseize or other ""I get to look at your hand cards"" are powerful *because* it takes away that hidden information. Powerful enough, that a T1 probe caused someone to scoop game1 during a tournament because they had a bad start and playing out the game was low%, better save information for game2 so the opponent has no idea what to sideboard. 

Slamming down things into control willy nilly is asking to lose, you need to bait out answers to establish board state. Combat math can quickly become a headache in some metas, the midgame of almost *any* matchup that isn't just one side getting fucked is much harder then you give credit for, and I don't know how you can look at any matchup in Vintage or Legacy (Ok, outside of Belcher and a few other 'do you have the answer?' decks) and call it simple. 

When it generally accepted that the game is complex, and all you say ""no it isn't, you just either draw a land or die"" people are going to expect you to elaborate, because the default is it's complex. So far you have not done so.

I'm not going to defend the mana system like some other people, though I will say it does add some interesting cases due to utility lands and interactions with things like Knight of the Reliquary - I still would personally prefer something like Force of Will's mana system over it.

4019,156,DaHolk,"&gt;I said “in part”, you might’ve glossed over that.

And my argument is still that you are putting the cart before the horse. I believe 5th edition exists because of the board game revival, not the other way around.

&gt;but as we know from a mile long list of Kickstarter failures

In the boardgame sector?
My argument was that self publishing before was still something rather rare, because it still required the same amount of guesswork of what might work or not, and how big an audience would be there.
And especially Kickstarter very quickly became a place in the boardgame space that allowed a tailored approach to manufacturing, you know exactly how many units you need to create and ship for the first run. So it enables individuals to propose a full game design with proposed assets, and can be a lot more precise with what productionvalue you can afford as a result.

&gt;making it so consumers are seeing what would otherwise be in a folder in some investors pigeonhole

Which clearly in your opinion has no influence on people BUYING them apparently. like, What?

&gt;I really think this is all less about Kickstarter &amp; more about the tabletop resurgence.

And my argument is that the availability of a vastly bigger and diverse range of options is a huge part of why the resurgence increased in speed. And Kickstarter is a huge part in getting from ""I made this game system, anyone actually interested"" to ""people are playing my game"" much more reliantly.

And secondly I don't really get what kind of ""dipp"" you are talking about if you are putting 5th edition D&amp;D as one of the causes for resurgence, rather than as profiting FROM it.

4022,159,SinntheticUCI,"Hmm, a big draw of the Tales franchise is the battle system.

Its sort of an action based system, with some rules set into stone - and most of the Tales games have different mechanics from one another. 

So there are basic attacks that are capped to a certain hit (some skills increase this) and abilities. Abilities and basic attacks is the basis of it, but it can get really interesting when you gain abilities that allow you to break these rules. In the beginning its really simple such as using 3 basic attacks into an ability - but it gets pretty creative when you learn more abilities that let you chain abilities together, or extend your basic attacks, or allow you to ability into basic attack etc. Thats a really simple explanation of it.

The passive skills system is similar to FFIX where abilities are tied to weapons and armor. So you need to keep items, and you can synthesize items together to make stronger items. And then you can equip those skills to increase certain attributes or let you break some of those combo rules.

The story is pretty generic and doesnt break any new ground, but a big draw to the game are the character interactions with one another, and the protagonist is pretty interesting.

The overworld is pretty big, and in classic JRPG style - you eventually gain an airship. The dungeons are pretty diverse and the overworld is big.

The tales franchise has a ton of replay value, and one of the best New Game+ systems in the business. Basically after every fight you are given a currency called ""grade"" that can be farmed if you want (there are ways to speed this up) and you spend grade when creating a new game +, that allows you to select SPECIFIC things that you can carry over or make the game more difficult. Like for example you can spend grade to increase the amount of exp you gain from monsters by 10x or 2x, you can carry over all your items if you want, or maybe you want a fresh start but you want to keep all the passive skills you kept, etc etc. Its a pretty cool system.

In ports of PS2 games the first thing that generally breaks is audio, the first 3 Devil May Cry games for example have had issues not only representing the original graphics, but audio is usually broken on at least some level, same with Metal Gear Solid 2 or even franchises that had yearly entries like Need for Speed having a consistently better experience with their audio on PS2 than on PC

4024,161,Aegisth,"&gt;Liberty can be used but it is bringing a knife to a gun fight in almost every single situation. The biggest problem with Civ 5 is that it discourages expansions. Cities take way to long to become a worthwhile investment.

The metagame of MP isn't optimized in vanilla BNW to the point that it really matters. Most people bring a gun to the gun fight but find they left their bullets at home, so your knife is more useful. The analogy is poor, but I'm saying that Tradition is not **so** powerful that an inexperienced player can use it and consistently beat even a decent Liberty player. 

Cities do take a while to become beneficial, but that means you want to get your cities out before Turn 40 or so in the latest on Quick speed. It also depends **a lot** on your land. All of this is moot too because your land says more about what's viable than anything else.

&gt;Horses used to be a real part of the rock paper scissors of the game but they've been reduced to being around only for movespeed and taking cities. They were much better implemented before.

I mean, you said they're useless. They're not. Even in normal combat, Horses are useful because they can easily pop in, hit, and pop out on a unit quicker than the opponent can react. 

&gt;Archers are best countered by having your own archers. Even being able to play around it doesn't mean its healthy. The game is super centralized around them.

It is, I don't disagree. That's not necessarily a bad thing and it only lasts until Crossbows. After Crossbows, archery units become obsolete. 

That doesn't mean Melee units are useless. If you bring 5 Archers into my 4 Archers and a spearmen fight, I'm going to win because of the spear.

&gt;Late game is boring due to expansion sucking. There ends up being nothing to do. You can't reasonably have a lot of cities to develop. Tiles upgrades run out real quick. Roading is often not worth the investment.

You have plenty of options in the late game. But I don't know waht you consider late game, honestly. I consider it Artillery-era. Public schools and Ideaologies, but that's because vanilla BNW MP forces you to bulb Great Scientists shortly after.

&gt;No need to be condescending. If you want more in depth explanation here's a comprehensive review by someone whose played a lot more Civ than either of us.

I'm not trying to be condescending. I'm annoyed. Your initial post shit on Civ 5 for reasons that I know aren't true, and you said with such confidence as if to say it's the way it is. Civ 5 isn't unbalanced in general and is perfectly viable to play in competitive MP.

That isn't to say it's perfect. It has **plenty** of problems, but they're not what you mentioned. The NQMod is a great example of the community acknowledging and fixing the problems of Civ 5.

**[tender loving care:](https://www.gog.com/game/tender_loving_care)** I loooove fmv in games, but never played this growing up when similar stuff was popular (though it seems to be making a comeback), so I figured for a euro I can't really go wrong. it's basically an erotic thriller with some psychology thrown in. while **phantasmagoria 2** managed to score one of the b-movie queens of the decade in monique parent (and the fine lady playing theresa and basically nobody else ever), I didn't recognize anyone here (aside from john hurt), but eyecandy is eyecandy and the whole thing was interesting and entertaining enough. what can I say, I'm a simple man and easily amused, though there's probably not much behind the psychological stuff.

it's the port of the mobile version (based on the overly redundant help screens full of tap this and tap that) and looks better than the original (based on media I saw earlier), but not as good as the dvd version, not sure why they didn't use that. it was based on a novel, which I didn't know, and was made by some folks from trilobyte. both **the 7th guest** and **the 11th hour** got mobile ports a while ago as well, but I don't think the digitally available pc versions got any improvements over the originals I still have in big boxes.

of course, [I ran into a bug](https://steamcommunity.com/app/593900/discussions/0/135512931360376371/). didn't want to finish the episode yet, said no, it played the intro again, I fast-forwarded it and couldn't click on anything afterwards. quit, saved, restarted, still the same. unresponsive ui was a problem at one point recently in **shadowrun dragonfall** as well, and of course I didn't back up my earlier save, I only quit for a short time, figured I'd continue soon anyway. shouldn't have saved after the ui thing but didn't want to lose progress, which I still did, so I had to re-do the whole thing from the last backup I had. motherfucker...

I fast-forwarded everything I could and you can turn off transitions, but it still took some time because you can't forward audio and I didn't want to skip anything in case it matters later, but it probably doesn't. I did get some different questions, they're picked randomly from a pool after each story bit, which makes sense on a full replay, but fucks up the current one's continuity, as they lead to longer or shorter (more/less skin) version of the same videos even if I pick the same answers when I get the same questions. then it happened again, same room, and you can only fucking save if you quit, so it's a pain to back your progress up regularly. also, on the 3rd try I only got the cut/clean/dressed version of every video in those chapters because, well, rng, I guess, I didn't pick the questions.

there are a few typos here and there, the most glaring being a your/you're mixup and 'masterbation' in a book written by a (non-existant) professional, who should definitely know how to spell words like that, and in another one about tantric sex. 'bushing up' instead of brushing up was a good one too. and I get that allison is going through stuff, but her journal looks like it was written by either a 5-year-old or a really crazy person, though the latter is not that far off, I guess. the radio show was hilarious though, and of course I watched all the clips after I was done to see what I'd missed. a few alternate lines and a bunch of alternate endings. mine was pretty cool, but the others were nice as well, there was even one I thought would happen but it didn't with my choices. it's about half an hour of extra footage, good stuff.

I was looking at other fmv stuff I'd missed as a kid available now for purchase and have **the journeyman project** trilogy wishlisted, but they have some timed elements, so I'm not sure. same with **night trap** and **the dame was loaded**, those are 'be in the right place at the right time' kinda deals and I hate those, didn't get too much out of **voyeur** way back when either (can't remember if I ever played the sequel). **double switch** is by the night trap people, never heard of it before, but it looks similar gameplay-wise.

didn't really like **under a killing moon** when it first came out, might be different now, along with the rest of the tex murphy games and **gabriel knight** (only the second is fmv and the third looked and played horribly even when it came out, glad there was a demo, but I never played much of the first either, maybe I should at some point, the second has been on my mind for decades but not so much as to play the first beforehand).

there's also **spycraft** but it doesn't seem up my alley either, but I've just wishlisted **titanic: adventure out of time**, gonna read up on it next time it's on sale. and of course there are modern games using fmv, already played **her story** and **press x to not die** and picked up **the infectious madness of doctor dekker** during the winter sale for later, plus have a few more wishlisted, waiting for better prices.

**[grotesque tactics: evil heroes:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/)** a turn-based fantasy strategy/rpg, kinda like **willy-nilly knight**, which I played a few months ago. tried it when onlive was a thing and had 30-minute trials for most games, looked good enough in a janky/cheesy way. it's supposed to take 12-15 hours (so 20+ for me), no need to bother with distributing stat points, it's done automatically, you can save anytime (though there are only 6 slots aside from one for auto and one for quicksaving) and it's linear and funny, there's even a 2x game speed option, though I'm not a fan of the art style in places, the ui is a bit too small in 1080p, should scale better, the camera's shit and there's some annoying screen flickering and combat mode activation is inconsistent too.

what makes it less than ideal are the following: fucking **xp-stealing npcs**, a'la **risen**. I expected some fuckery, so I attacked what they already weakened, but they still took out some enemies. certain mobs also fight among themselves, which is pretty cool, but also takes xp from me by the time I get to them. also, **only the person attacking or killing gets xp**, not everyone in the party, so have to let everyone have a go, which can get tedious and/or dangerous, and **no automatic healing after battle** either, unless there's a shrine nearby that also heals enemies (unlike in **two worlds**). you can heal for a small fee in town, but also get healed for free before leaving, so why?

there's a healer, only from up-close and in battle and not herself. don't think mana regenerates outside shrines, but she gets xp for healing. and **units killed in battle can't be brought back until you go back to town**, which can only be done after clearing the entire map. there's a console, so I'm not gonna reload every turn for the best result, just roll with it, and if I end up gimped (or dead) because fucking npcs don't let me kill everything or I didn't manage to level everyone equally (already an issue, my main guy does everything because he can), I'll just cheat, not gonna worry about it.

obsession is a unique mechanic. killing fills it up, then the character's special attack happens, boost, killing spree, etc. then depression follows. looting's weird too: opening chests doesn't count as an action in combat, but the loot command can be executed from further away, so it can be used to get closer or further away from enemies. inventory is shared, but in combat you can only fuck around with a character's equipment during their turn. and you can buy and sell stuff for the same price, merchants don't have much of a business sense. I've just cleared the cave near westwind, but my party is already at 7 people. fun game so far.

**[avalon legends solitaire 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512260/)** played the first about a year ago, picked up the third in the last sale (gotta love those extra bundle discounts), was still in the mood for solitare after **didgery**, so I started this. run-of-the-mill solitaire with some resource management, you need to rebuild camelot because goblins.

it's not advised to restart a hand if you don't get 3 stars because resources can be collected after every hand, so just go with it and replay levels from the map. fine with me, I hate games where you can't replay a single hand and have to retry countless times until rng and/or wildcards let you get 3 stars, and level 20 and a few others took several dozen tries, didn't want to spend 400 gold on a joker, so I kept trying and only used a few wildcards.

quitting the game is only possible while playing a level, and there's a player already created with only the first letter in upper-case, but you can only create new players with full caps, and it doesn't matter anyway, the game still calls you mallard. and one of the dudes [told me off](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1622923938) for building a magic tower for power-ups instead of providing more food and such. you hired a druid with a deck of magic cards to help you out, what did you expect? there's a metric fuckton of levels (300, to be exact), so it'll keep me busy for a while. or about a week if I don't feel like doing much else.

4028,165,diglyd,"**Need For Speed 2015** \- Much better then I thought it would be. It feels like Most Wanted and the graphics are very NFS underground 2 with wet, slick night city driving. The cars feel fast, and the customization is pretty sweet. The story is corny with a ton of fist bumping but this is one of the reasons why I loved all the NFS games.  I am really enjoying this one. Also, the soundtrack is pretty good. 

Need for Speed Payback: After picking up NFS 2015 I decided to give Payback a shot. This game should not be called NFS but ""Fast and Furious Nevada land Desert Adventure."" This game really infuriated me. First of all the first 40+ minutes is basically a single player scripted story of how you get screwed out of a heist and have to then work as a valet at a casino for the dude that hired you. Only after a few scripted races and all that bs does the game open up into an open world game.  The graphics are pretty but I feel like a downgrade from NFS 2015. Maybe not a downgrade but they look different. The open world is very small but dense and I am not a fan of the Nevada / Arizona Land and Fake Las Vegas Desert setting. While NFS 2015 felt like old school NFS street racing Payback feels more like demolition derby as you are fighting against ""the company"" and they send black SUV goons after you constantly to push you off the road. I got flashbacks from playing NFS the Run and that was shit. 

The worst thing is that every single time something interesting is about to happen during a race the game yanks control from you and instead puts in a cutscene. So, in the end, you are just doing the most mundane stuff during a race and then watching a scripted event. Its like EA decided that it would be great if every time you got excited they would take the reward away from you. 

I would say the best NFS games are still

1. Most Wanted - X360 (because the cops were the best here, the blacklist, the ahole bad guy, and the open world). 
2. NFS Hot Pursuit 2010
3. NFS Underground 2 (best old school street racing feel). 
4. NFS Carbon (they dumbed down the cops here but the game was still sweet). 
5. NFS 2015
6. NFS Rivals / NFS Payback

Payback isn't terrible. The open world is fun, the graphics and diversity of locations is nice (although I would love to see some trains go by and a dam or something), the various different types of races are cool, and the car variety is nice but the game has way too many off-road events, the cars are way to hard to handle unless you use a drift car, it feels like demolition derby most of the time, and the whole wannabe Forza Horizon + Fast and Furious heist crew really turned me off to the game. 

**Destiny 2** \- Finally finished the story and got to level 29. Really enjoying the game but I was really disappointed with how the story ended. I really liked the Consul (Ghaul's friend and father figure) and hoped to fight him as a boss at some point. Dude was cool and the way Bungie dealt with him was weak and anticlimactic. Same goes for Ghaul. They were both actually cool and interesting characters and they got killed off pretty quick. What a shame. That is some really poor writing there Bungie. 

Also once you finish the story the game opens up and you can do all this other stuff which most of is not explained and the descriptions of how upgrades work or where you get what are vague. 

Still, the game is a blast to play. I've got more playtime and value out of this game than any other game in the last few years. Last game that sucked me in this deep was Mass Effect series (not counting Guildwars 2). I am looking forward to diving into Forsaken. 

If anyone plays Destiny I have a question. If I have an exotic weapon and lets say I got it when I was like level 17 and now I am lvl 30 and the weapon was like power level 150 and now I can reclaim it and it will be like power level 250 is it better to do that or do I just upgrade the weapon using a higher level weapon and upgrade components (shards, cores etc) or do I reclaim the weapon and then upgrade it? This is kind of confusing. What's the point of upgrading a weapon when you can just reclaim it every few levels and get better stats? Also, where do you get enhancement cores?

4030,167,lenaro,"I think it's a good game with some big flaws. Mainly, the game-feel gets a ***lot*** worse the further you get into the game.

Obviously, moderate spoilers ahead.

There are three big reasons the gameplay gets worse:

1 - You cannot use the Seamoth below the Lost River. The Seamoth is the most fun vehicle with the fastest and most responsive gameplay, but its maximum depth means you're forced to use the Prawn and Cyclops. The Prawn and Cyclops just blow from a gameplay standpoint. The Cyclops is really cool, but it’s so big and slow and clunky to steer that it’s really tedious to use. The Prawn just sucks in general.

2 – All the lategame locations are caves within caves within caves. (For instance, Blood Kelp Trench -&gt; Lost River -&gt; Descend past Tree Cove -&gt; Inactive Lava Zone -&gt; Active Lava Zone.) This accentuates the problems with the Cyclops and Prawn, because you have to drive the Cyclops through these caves all the way down, and you can’t even bring your Seamoth with you in case you want to head back to the surface after setting up a little base in the Lost River. This also really undermines the game’s thalassophobia feel, because often you can either see the entire cave you’re in, or you’re just walking along on the ground so you don’t need to worry about the ocean beneath you.

3 – The inventory system is pretty clunky and it’s really the most noticeable in the late game when you have lots of resources to manage, and building complex structures or upgrades becomes really annoying.


So… I would make some changes to the game.

For one thing, I’d add one extra submersible. It would have all the capabilities of the *current* Seamoth, including its maximum depth limit. This submersible would be obtained from a mid-to-late wreck, perhaps in the Dunes or Bulb Zone. I would then nerf the original Seamoth, by reducing its maximum speed a bit and reducing its maneuverability substantially. Why? Because the Seamoth is simply far too good to be obtained in the first couple of hours of the game. I would make it less powerful and useful -- to make upgrading it feel really nice. I know this is probably controversial, but think of it this way: you don’t get wings in Terraria right at the start. They’re a huge upgrade in the mid-game and it’s incredible. Subnautica gives you the Seamoth upgrade when you’ve barely gotten used to the Seaglide.

Next, I would change the Cyclops. It should be at least as fast as the current Seamoth, but I would argue it should be 15-20% faster than the Seamoth at standard speed. Why? Because it’s so clunky to move around in caves that it needs something to compensate for that. Also, I think making the cameras part of the HUD would help quite a bit in improving awareness of the surrounding area. 

(This is an unreasonable change, but I also think the Lost River should be quite a lot wider and taller, because it’s a huge pain in the ass to drive around in.)

I would also change the Prawn suit. I would add backwards-firing thrusters on a dedicated hotkey, to make moving around much quicker. It’s stupid as hell that you need to use the grapple arm to have any decent speed. The Prawn is a big reason the lategame of Subnautica feels really miserable.

But the Prawn also needs some other perks to make it feel really good. I would increase its base walking speed by around 30%, and upgrade the baseline jump jets to around half the power the jump jets module adds. 

Most importantly, I think, I would upgrade the Prawn’s external lights to light up the area around its feet and light up an entire 360-degree view, as well as make them about as bright as the Cyclops. It really sucks that you can’t even see a resource that’s right at your feet. I think every vehicle should have its own area where it excels, and being able to see everything around you would be a good perk for the Prawn. Perhaps it should have a sonar module as well.

I would also make a couple of other changes. 

I’ve been playing with a map mod and it really improves how the game feels. I’d add a map module (which fills in as you explore) for the Seamoth and Cyclops, obtained from the Aurora wreck. Perhaps you could take a Hollow Knight approach with this, and add data downloads to each biome that allow you to map that area. That would be cool.

Also, the auto-sorter mod is extremely useful. It basically turns the storage of the game into something like Terraria’s auto-sort button. There’s no reason that shouldn’t be baseline.

The hotbar needs more slots. No reason this shouldn’t be baseline. The hotbar system in general is kinda… awkward. 

Seaglide map and light should be on different buttons. There’s a mod for this (Seaglide Map Controls) and it really helps.

Can’t really think of much else right now.

4031,168,Dataforge,"&gt; For sure it can be done, but is it fun to basically fly through nothing?

It could be. Have you ever played Silent Hunter? Submarine controls can be fun and interesting without having to worry about colliding into things.

For one, I almost never used silent running, or even lowered my speed. That's because I almost never took my Cyclops anywhere other than the Lost River, and the caves below it. When you encounter one of the few leviathans in the cave, you can't really sneak past them. So I just turned on my shields, and kept pushing forward until they stopped bothering me. I never really bothered with torpedoes either, not that they really did anything anyway.

If I had a need to take the Cyclops out to the open ocean, where the full sized reapers and ghost leviathans are, that would have been way more tense. Imagine running silent, while watching a reaper swim by, hoping he doesn't see you, hoping that the roar you hear in the distance gets fainter and fainter. If torpedoes were more effective, you could use them to get out of a tricky situation if a leviathan spots you. You would have to constantly stay alert, so you see the leviathans before they see you.

You would have to load up your Cyclops with resources, because there would be none in the open ocean. Maybe, if you're lucky, you'll find a few small fish you can eat. But for the most part your Cyclops and what's on it is all you have. Outside your Cyclops, it's just certain death, and that's a scary thought.",1547447179,1,1547443579.0,Need for Speed,0.9955284
4032,169,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Need for Speed,0.04236541
4033,170,AzurewynD,"The easiest way starting out is to find a copper vein outside a city and mine some before selling it to a vendor (you don't need a pickaxe or anything special for this). If you do it a few times you can get yourself a few thousand cats to buy food so you won't starve.

You can also click the ""sneak"" button on the lower right of the screen and sneak around and steal things to make a buck. Sneaking by itself isn't illegal as long as you aren't trespassing, even if people see you. As long as you're moving in sneak mode around anything that can potentially see you, you'll level your sneak skill up. 

Another few important little tidbits: as you run around without being encumbered, you'll level your athletics stat. 

Once you get to around 30-40 athletics and you can run around 20-25 mph, you'll be able to outrun *most* threats you come across provided your legs are healthy (except for long necked dinosaur looking things, yikes). This will let you pick and choose your engagements rather than being ambushed.

This'll also allow you to bait big packs of bandits from the middle of nowhere into chasing you all the way into cities, where you can start big battles between them and the guards, that you can then join in on so you're not in danger of dying alone and helpless.

If you run around while heavily encumbered, you'll level your strength stat instead which helps your carry weight, unarmed fighting, and fighting with large weapons.

4034,171,Ryuujinx,"I decided to scroll through your history to see if you posted frequently about what you would call complicated to find a thread where you were playing love letter wrong, which I found hilarious. That said, I would be interested in what you would consider more complex - I can certainly think of some things, but they're generally going to be several hour ordeals like Twilight Imperium. 

The reason mtg is complex is *because* of those interactions you wave away, as well as hidden information and instant speed answers. Things like Duress, Thoughtseize or other ""I get to look at your hand cards"" are powerful *because* it takes away that hidden information. Powerful enough, that a T1 probe caused someone to scoop game1 during a tournament because they had a bad start and playing out the game was low%, better save information for game2 so the opponent has no idea what to sideboard. 

Slamming down things into control willy nilly is asking to lose, you need to bait out answers to establish board state. Combat math can quickly become a headache in some metas, the midgame of almost *any* matchup that isn't just one side getting fucked is much harder then you give credit for, and I don't know how you can look at any matchup in Vintage or Legacy (Ok, outside of Belcher and a few other 'do you have the answer?' decks) and call it simple. 

When it generally accepted that the game is complex, and all you say ""no it isn't, you just either draw a land or die"" people are going to expect you to elaborate, because the default is it's complex. So far you have not done so.

I'm not going to defend the mana system like some other people, though I will say it does add some interesting cases due to utility lands and interactions with things like Knight of the Reliquary - I still would personally prefer something like Force of Will's mana system over it.

4036,173,SinntheticUCI,"Hmm, a big draw of the Tales franchise is the battle system.

Its sort of an action based system, with some rules set into stone - and most of the Tales games have different mechanics from one another. 

So there are basic attacks that are capped to a certain hit (some skills increase this) and abilities. Abilities and basic attacks is the basis of it, but it can get really interesting when you gain abilities that allow you to break these rules. In the beginning its really simple such as using 3 basic attacks into an ability - but it gets pretty creative when you learn more abilities that let you chain abilities together, or extend your basic attacks, or allow you to ability into basic attack etc. Thats a really simple explanation of it.

The passive skills system is similar to FFIX where abilities are tied to weapons and armor. So you need to keep items, and you can synthesize items together to make stronger items. And then you can equip those skills to increase certain attributes or let you break some of those combo rules.

The story is pretty generic and doesnt break any new ground, but a big draw to the game are the character interactions with one another, and the protagonist is pretty interesting.

The overworld is pretty big, and in classic JRPG style - you eventually gain an airship. The dungeons are pretty diverse and the overworld is big.

The tales franchise has a ton of replay value, and one of the best New Game+ systems in the business. Basically after every fight you are given a currency called ""grade"" that can be farmed if you want (there are ways to speed this up) and you spend grade when creating a new game +, that allows you to select SPECIFIC things that you can carry over or make the game more difficult. Like for example you can spend grade to increase the amount of exp you gain from monsters by 10x or 2x, you can carry over all your items if you want, or maybe you want a fresh start but you want to keep all the passive skills you kept, etc etc. Its a pretty cool system.

In ports of PS2 games the first thing that generally breaks is audio, the first 3 Devil May Cry games for example have had issues not only representing the original graphics, but audio is usually broken on at least some level, same with Metal Gear Solid 2 or even franchises that had yearly entries like Need for Speed having a consistently better experience with their audio on PS2 than on PC

4038,175,Aegisth,"&gt;Liberty can be used but it is bringing a knife to a gun fight in almost every single situation. The biggest problem with Civ 5 is that it discourages expansions. Cities take way to long to become a worthwhile investment.

The metagame of MP isn't optimized in vanilla BNW to the point that it really matters. Most people bring a gun to the gun fight but find they left their bullets at home, so your knife is more useful. The analogy is poor, but I'm saying that Tradition is not **so** powerful that an inexperienced player can use it and consistently beat even a decent Liberty player. 

Cities do take a while to become beneficial, but that means you want to get your cities out before Turn 40 or so in the latest on Quick speed. It also depends **a lot** on your land. All of this is moot too because your land says more about what's viable than anything else.

&gt;Horses used to be a real part of the rock paper scissors of the game but they've been reduced to being around only for movespeed and taking cities. They were much better implemented before.

I mean, you said they're useless. They're not. Even in normal combat, Horses are useful because they can easily pop in, hit, and pop out on a unit quicker than the opponent can react. 

&gt;Archers are best countered by having your own archers. Even being able to play around it doesn't mean its healthy. The game is super centralized around them.

It is, I don't disagree. That's not necessarily a bad thing and it only lasts until Crossbows. After Crossbows, archery units become obsolete. 

That doesn't mean Melee units are useless. If you bring 5 Archers into my 4 Archers and a spearmen fight, I'm going to win because of the spear.

&gt;Late game is boring due to expansion sucking. There ends up being nothing to do. You can't reasonably have a lot of cities to develop. Tiles upgrades run out real quick. Roading is often not worth the investment.

You have plenty of options in the late game. But I don't know waht you consider late game, honestly. I consider it Artillery-era. Public schools and Ideaologies, but that's because vanilla BNW MP forces you to bulb Great Scientists shortly after.

I'm not trying to be condescending. I'm annoyed. Your initial post shit on Civ 5 for reasons that I know aren't true, and you said with such confidence as if to say it's the way it is. Civ 5 isn't unbalanced in general and is perfectly viable to play in competitive MP.

That isn't to say it's perfect. It has **plenty** of problems, but they're not what you mentioned. The NQMod is a great example of the community acknowledging and fixing the problems of Civ 5.

**[tender loving care:](https://www.gog.com/game/tender_loving_care)** I loooove fmv in games, but never played this growing up when similar stuff was popular (though it seems to be making a comeback), so I figured for a euro I can't really go wrong. it's basically an erotic thriller with some psychology thrown in. while **phantasmagoria 2** managed to score one of the b-movie queens of the decade in monique parent (and the fine lady playing theresa and basically nobody else ever), I didn't recognize anyone here (aside from john hurt), but eyecandy is eyecandy and the whole thing was interesting and entertaining enough. what can I say, I'm a simple man and easily amused, though there's probably not much behind the psychological stuff.

it's the port of the mobile version (based on the overly redundant help screens full of tap this and tap that) and looks better than the original (based on media I saw earlier), but not as good as the dvd version, not sure why they didn't use that. it was based on a novel, which I didn't know, and was made by some folks from trilobyte. both **the 7th guest** and **the 11th hour** got mobile ports a while ago as well, but I don't think the digitally available pc versions got any improvements over the originals I still have in big boxes.

of course, [I ran into a bug](https://steamcommunity.com/app/593900/discussions/0/135512931360376371/). didn't want to finish the episode yet, said no, it played the intro again, I fast-forwarded it and couldn't click on anything afterwards. quit, saved, restarted, still the same. unresponsive ui was a problem at one point recently in **shadowrun dragonfall** as well, and of course I didn't back up my earlier save, I only quit for a short time, figured I'd continue soon anyway. shouldn't have saved after the ui thing but didn't want to lose progress, which I still did, so I had to re-do the whole thing from the last backup I had. motherfucker...

I fast-forwarded everything I could and you can turn off transitions, but it still took some time because you can't forward audio and I didn't want to skip anything in case it matters later, but it probably doesn't. I did get some different questions, they're picked randomly from a pool after each story bit, which makes sense on a full replay, but fucks up the current one's continuity, as they lead to longer or shorter (more/less skin) version of the same videos even if I pick the same answers when I get the same questions. then it happened again, same room, and you can only fucking save if you quit, so it's a pain to back your progress up regularly. also, on the 3rd try I only got the cut/clean/dressed version of every video in those chapters because, well, rng, I guess, I didn't pick the questions.

there are a few typos here and there, the most glaring being a your/you're mixup and 'masterbation' in a book written by a (non-existant) professional, who should definitely know how to spell words like that, and in another one about tantric sex. 'bushing up' instead of brushing up was a good one too. and I get that allison is going through stuff, but her journal looks like it was written by either a 5-year-old or a really crazy person, though the latter is not that far off, I guess. the radio show was hilarious though, and of course I watched all the clips after I was done to see what I'd missed. a few alternate lines and a bunch of alternate endings. mine was pretty cool, but the others were nice as well, there was even one I thought would happen but it didn't with my choices. it's about half an hour of extra footage, good stuff.

I was looking at other fmv stuff I'd missed as a kid available now for purchase and have **the journeyman project** trilogy wishlisted, but they have some timed elements, so I'm not sure. same with **night trap** and **the dame was loaded**, those are 'be in the right place at the right time' kinda deals and I hate those, didn't get too much out of **voyeur** way back when either (can't remember if I ever played the sequel). **double switch** is by the night trap people, never heard of it before, but it looks similar gameplay-wise.

didn't really like **under a killing moon** when it first came out, might be different now, along with the rest of the tex murphy games and **gabriel knight** (only the second is fmv and the third looked and played horribly even when it came out, glad there was a demo, but I never played much of the first either, maybe I should at some point, the second has been on my mind for decades but not so much as to play the first beforehand).

there's also **spycraft** but it doesn't seem up my alley either, but I've just wishlisted **titanic: adventure out of time**, gonna read up on it next time it's on sale. and of course there are modern games using fmv, already played **her story** and **press x to not die** and picked up **the infectious madness of doctor dekker** during the winter sale for later, plus have a few more wishlisted, waiting for better prices.

**[grotesque tactics: evil heroes:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/)** a turn-based fantasy strategy/rpg, kinda like **willy-nilly knight**, which I played a few months ago. tried it when onlive was a thing and had 30-minute trials for most games, looked good enough in a janky/cheesy way. it's supposed to take 12-15 hours (so 20+ for me), no need to bother with distributing stat points, it's done automatically, you can save anytime (though there are only 6 slots aside from one for auto and one for quicksaving) and it's linear and funny, there's even a 2x game speed option, though I'm not a fan of the art style in places, the ui is a bit too small in 1080p, should scale better, the camera's shit and there's some annoying screen flickering and combat mode activation is inconsistent too.

what makes it less than ideal are the following: fucking **xp-stealing npcs**, a'la **risen**. I expected some fuckery, so I attacked what they already weakened, but they still took out some enemies. certain mobs also fight among themselves, which is pretty cool, but also takes xp from me by the time I get to them. also, **only the person attacking or killing gets xp**, not everyone in the party, so have to let everyone have a go, which can get tedious and/or dangerous, and **no automatic healing after battle** either, unless there's a shrine nearby that also heals enemies (unlike in **two worlds**). you can heal for a small fee in town, but also get healed for free before leaving, so why?

there's a healer, only from up-close and in battle and not herself. don't think mana regenerates outside shrines, but she gets xp for healing. and **units killed in battle can't be brought back until you go back to town**, which can only be done after clearing the entire map. there's a console, so I'm not gonna reload every turn for the best result, just roll with it, and if I end up gimped (or dead) because fucking npcs don't let me kill everything or I didn't manage to level everyone equally (already an issue, my main guy does everything because he can), I'll just cheat, not gonna worry about it.

obsession is a unique mechanic. killing fills it up, then the character's special attack happens, boost, killing spree, etc. then depression follows. looting's weird too: opening chests doesn't count as an action in combat, but the loot command can be executed from further away, so it can be used to get closer or further away from enemies. inventory is shared, but in combat you can only fuck around with a character's equipment during their turn. and you can buy and sell stuff for the same price, merchants don't have much of a business sense. I've just cleared the cave near westwind, but my party is already at 7 people. fun game so far.

**[avalon legends solitaire 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512260/)** played the first about a year ago, picked up the third in the last sale (gotta love those extra bundle discounts), was still in the mood for solitare after **didgery**, so I started this. run-of-the-mill solitaire with some resource management, you need to rebuild camelot because goblins.

it's not advised to restart a hand if you don't get 3 stars because resources can be collected after every hand, so just go with it and replay levels from the map. fine with me, I hate games where you can't replay a single hand and have to retry countless times until rng and/or wildcards let you get 3 stars, and level 20 and a few others took several dozen tries, didn't want to spend 400 gold on a joker, so I kept trying and only used a few wildcards.

quitting the game is only possible while playing a level, and there's a player already created with only the first letter in upper-case, but you can only create new players with full caps, and it doesn't matter anyway, the game still calls you mallard. and one of the dudes [told me off](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1622923938) for building a magic tower for power-ups instead of providing more food and such. you hired a druid with a deck of magic cards to help you out, what did you expect? there's a metric fuckton of levels (300, to be exact), so it'll keep me busy for a while. or about a week if I don't feel like doing much else.

4042,179,diglyd,"**Need For Speed 2015** \- Much better then I thought it would be. It feels like Most Wanted and the graphics are very NFS underground 2 with wet, slick night city driving. The cars feel fast, and the customization is pretty sweet. The story is corny with a ton of fist bumping but this is one of the reasons why I loved all the NFS games.  I am really enjoying this one. Also, the soundtrack is pretty good. 

Need for Speed Payback: After picking up NFS 2015 I decided to give Payback a shot. This game should not be called NFS but ""Fast and Furious Nevada land Desert Adventure."" This game really infuriated me. First of all the first 40+ minutes is basically a single player scripted story of how you get screwed out of a heist and have to then work as a valet at a casino for the dude that hired you. Only after a few scripted races and all that bs does the game open up into an open world game.  The graphics are pretty but I feel like a downgrade from NFS 2015. Maybe not a downgrade but they look different. The open world is very small but dense and I am not a fan of the Nevada / Arizona Land and Fake Las Vegas Desert setting. While NFS 2015 felt like old school NFS street racing Payback feels more like demolition derby as you are fighting against ""the company"" and they send black SUV goons after you constantly to push you off the road. I got flashbacks from playing NFS the Run and that was shit. 

The worst thing is that every single time something interesting is about to happen during a race the game yanks control from you and instead puts in a cutscene. So, in the end, you are just doing the most mundane stuff during a race and then watching a scripted event. Its like EA decided that it would be great if every time you got excited they would take the reward away from you. 

I would say the best NFS games are still

1. Most Wanted - X360 (because the cops were the best here, the blacklist, the ahole bad guy, and the open world). 
2. NFS Hot Pursuit 2010
3. NFS Underground 2 (best old school street racing feel). 
4. NFS Carbon (they dumbed down the cops here but the game was still sweet). 
5. NFS 2015
6. NFS Rivals / NFS Payback

Payback isn't terrible. The open world is fun, the graphics and diversity of locations is nice (although I would love to see some trains go by and a dam or something), the various different types of races are cool, and the car variety is nice but the game has way too many off-road events, the cars are way to hard to handle unless you use a drift car, it feels like demolition derby most of the time, and the whole wannabe Forza Horizon + Fast and Furious heist crew really turned me off to the game. 

**Destiny 2** \- Finally finished the story and got to level 29. Really enjoying the game but I was really disappointed with how the story ended. I really liked the Consul (Ghaul's friend and father figure) and hoped to fight him as a boss at some point. Dude was cool and the way Bungie dealt with him was weak and anticlimactic. Same goes for Ghaul. They were both actually cool and interesting characters and they got killed off pretty quick. What a shame. That is some really poor writing there Bungie. 

Also once you finish the story the game opens up and you can do all this other stuff which most of is not explained and the descriptions of how upgrades work or where you get what are vague. 

Still, the game is a blast to play. I've got more playtime and value out of this game than any other game in the last few years. Last game that sucked me in this deep was Mass Effect series (not counting Guildwars 2). I am looking forward to diving into Forsaken. 

If anyone plays Destiny I have a question. If I have an exotic weapon and lets say I got it when I was like level 17 and now I am lvl 30 and the weapon was like power level 150 and now I can reclaim it and it will be like power level 250 is it better to do that or do I just upgrade the weapon using a higher level weapon and upgrade components (shards, cores etc) or do I reclaim the weapon and then upgrade it? This is kind of confusing. What's the point of upgrading a weapon when you can just reclaim it every few levels and get better stats? Also, where do you get enhancement cores?

4043,180,lenaro,"I think it's a good game with some big flaws. Mainly, the game-feel gets a ***lot*** worse the further you get into the game.

Obviously, moderate spoilers ahead.

There are three big reasons the gameplay gets worse:

1 - You cannot use the Seamoth below the Lost River. The Seamoth is the most fun vehicle with the fastest and most responsive gameplay, but its maximum depth means you're forced to use the Prawn and Cyclops. The Prawn and Cyclops just blow from a gameplay standpoint. The Cyclops is really cool, but it’s so big and slow and clunky to steer that it’s really tedious to use. The Prawn just sucks in general.

2 – All the lategame locations are caves within caves within caves. (For instance, Blood Kelp Trench -&gt; Lost River -&gt; Descend past Tree Cove -&gt; Inactive Lava Zone -&gt; Active Lava Zone.) This accentuates the problems with the Cyclops and Prawn, because you have to drive the Cyclops through these caves all the way down, and you can’t even bring your Seamoth with you in case you want to head back to the surface after setting up a little base in the Lost River. This also really undermines the game’s thalassophobia feel, because often you can either see the entire cave you’re in, or you’re just walking along on the ground so you don’t need to worry about the ocean beneath you.

3 – The inventory system is pretty clunky and it’s really the most noticeable in the late game when you have lots of resources to manage, and building complex structures or upgrades becomes really annoying.


So… I would make some changes to the game.

For one thing, I’d add one extra submersible. It would have all the capabilities of the *current* Seamoth, including its maximum depth limit. This submersible would be obtained from a mid-to-late wreck, perhaps in the Dunes or Bulb Zone. I would then nerf the original Seamoth, by reducing its maximum speed a bit and reducing its maneuverability substantially. Why? Because the Seamoth is simply far too good to be obtained in the first couple of hours of the game. I would make it less powerful and useful -- to make upgrading it feel really nice. I know this is probably controversial, but think of it this way: you don’t get wings in Terraria right at the start. They’re a huge upgrade in the mid-game and it’s incredible. Subnautica gives you the Seamoth upgrade when you’ve barely gotten used to the Seaglide.

Next, I would change the Cyclops. It should be at least as fast as the current Seamoth, but I would argue it should be 15-20% faster than the Seamoth at standard speed. Why? Because it’s so clunky to move around in caves that it needs something to compensate for that. Also, I think making the cameras part of the HUD would help quite a bit in improving awareness of the surrounding area. 

(This is an unreasonable change, but I also think the Lost River should be quite a lot wider and taller, because it’s a huge pain in the ass to drive around in.)

I would also change the Prawn suit. I would add backwards-firing thrusters on a dedicated hotkey, to make moving around much quicker. It’s stupid as hell that you need to use the grapple arm to have any decent speed. The Prawn is a big reason the lategame of Subnautica feels really miserable.

But the Prawn also needs some other perks to make it feel really good. I would increase its base walking speed by around 30%, and upgrade the baseline jump jets to around half the power the jump jets module adds. 

Most importantly, I think, I would upgrade the Prawn’s external lights to light up the area around its feet and light up an entire 360-degree view, as well as make them about as bright as the Cyclops. It really sucks that you can’t even see a resource that’s right at your feet. I think every vehicle should have its own area where it excels, and being able to see everything around you would be a good perk for the Prawn. Perhaps it should have a sonar module as well.

I would also make a couple of other changes. 

I’ve been playing with a map mod and it really improves how the game feels. I’d add a map module (which fills in as you explore) for the Seamoth and Cyclops, obtained from the Aurora wreck. Perhaps you could take a Hollow Knight approach with this, and add data downloads to each biome that allow you to map that area. That would be cool.

Also, the auto-sorter mod is extremely useful. It basically turns the storage of the game into something like Terraria’s auto-sort button. There’s no reason that shouldn’t be baseline.

The hotbar needs more slots. No reason this shouldn’t be baseline. The hotbar system in general is kinda… awkward. 

Seaglide map and light should be on different buttons. There’s a mod for this (Seaglide Map Controls) and it really helps.

Can’t really think of much else right now.

4044,181,Dataforge,"&gt; For sure it can be done, but is it fun to basically fly through nothing?

It could be. Have you ever played Silent Hunter? Submarine controls can be fun and interesting without having to worry about colliding into things.

For one, I almost never used silent running, or even lowered my speed. That's because I almost never took my Cyclops anywhere other than the Lost River, and the caves below it. When you encounter one of the few leviathans in the cave, you can't really sneak past them. So I just turned on my shields, and kept pushing forward until they stopped bothering me. I never really bothered with torpedoes either, not that they really did anything anyway.

If I had a need to take the Cyclops out to the open ocean, where the full sized reapers and ghost leviathans are, that would have been way more tense. Imagine running silent, while watching a reaper swim by, hoping he doesn't see you, hoping that the roar you hear in the distance gets fainter and fainter. If torpedoes were more effective, you could use them to get out of a tricky situation if a leviathan spots you. You would have to constantly stay alert, so you see the leviathans before they see you.

You would have to load up your Cyclops with resources, because there would be none in the open ocean. Maybe, if you're lucky, you'll find a few small fish you can eat. But for the most part your Cyclops and what's on it is all you have. Outside your Cyclops, it's just certain death, and that's a scary thought.",1547447179,1,1547443579.0,Need for Speed,0.9955284
4045,182,FilthyBrokenAnimal,"The problem with that argument is that EA actually has a larger physical scale of titles sold than most publishers. FIFA is a huge physical seller with a physical/digital share of around 80/20 and outside of the sports franchises and Battlefield they really don't have much to show in the way of commercial success. Most of their franchises are basically corpses: Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect all commercial failures this gen. They just haven't really had much of a presence this generation outside of FIFA, Madden and NHL. Almost every game of theirs outside of those three franchises has been a critical and commercial flop. Origin on the PC has damaged their standard among PC gamers, for whom EA games are basically invisible to anyone who doesn't have the Origin client installed on their PC.

Also, the idea that downloads are ""taking over more of the market"" is misleading. Yes, I saw that article about ""80% of the industry being digital"". But if you exclude microtransactions &amp; mobile - both of which account for a substantial share of the market but are both heavily jeopardised by ethical, legal and consumer opinion issues (including the prospect of strict legislation and subjugation to gambling laws), not to mention that the market is turning against F2P in pretty spectacular fashion. Physical/digital sales shares gravitated between 65/35 and 80/20 for most games in 2014, and it's still that way now. I don't see it shifting much in the future, except where certain factors influence that balance (for example, games that have been released digitally months or even years before the physical launch, an increasingly common occurrence with indie titles).

I can also imagine that game sharing - which accounts for a substantial share of digital purchases - is going to be the new, highly-publicised ""used games/piracy"" bête noire for the industry this year, and a clampdown will probably hurt digital in a big way.

Incidentally, it's always worth considering the axiom ""watch what they do, not what they say"". EA in particular has been rattling the ""digital-only"" saber for a while now, predicting the imminent demise of physical for the better part of 15 years. Remember John Riccitiello's annual prophecies? And yet, this entire generation, they have released just three games as digital-only titles on the current generation of consoles - and two of those have just seen a physical release.",1547461670,1,1547458070.0,Need for Speed,0.04236541
4046,183,AzurewynD,"The easiest way starting out is to find a copper vein outside a city and mine some before selling it to a vendor (you don't need a pickaxe or anything special for this). If you do it a few times you can get yourself a few thousand cats to buy food so you won't starve.

You can also click the ""sneak"" button on the lower right of the screen and sneak around and steal things to make a buck. Sneaking by itself isn't illegal as long as you aren't trespassing, even if people see you. As long as you're moving in sneak mode around anything that can potentially see you, you'll level your sneak skill up. 

Another few important little tidbits: as you run around without being encumbered, you'll level your athletics stat. 

Once you get to around 30-40 athletics and you can run around 20-25 mph, you'll be able to outrun *most* threats you come across provided your legs are healthy (except for long necked dinosaur looking things, yikes). This will let you pick and choose your engagements rather than being ambushed.

This'll also allow you to bait big packs of bandits from the middle of nowhere into chasing you all the way into cities, where you can start big battles between them and the guards, that you can then join in on so you're not in danger of dying alone and helpless.

If you run around while heavily encumbered, you'll level your strength stat instead which helps your carry weight, unarmed fighting, and fighting with large weapons.

Its sort of an action based system, with some rules set into stone - and most of the Tales games have different mechanics from one another. 

So there are basic attacks that are capped to a certain hit (some skills increase this) and abilities. Abilities and basic attacks is the basis of it, but it can get really interesting when you gain abilities that allow you to break these rules. In the beginning its really simple such as using 3 basic attacks into an ability - but it gets pretty creative when you learn more abilities that let you chain abilities together, or extend your basic attacks, or allow you to ability into basic attack etc. Thats a really simple explanation of it.

The passive skills system is similar to FFIX where abilities are tied to weapons and armor. So you need to keep items, and you can synthesize items together to make stronger items. And then you can equip those skills to increase certain attributes or let you break some of those combo rules.

The story is pretty generic and doesnt break any new ground, but a big draw to the game are the character interactions with one another, and the protagonist is pretty interesting.

The tales franchise has a ton of replay value, and one of the best New Game+ systems in the business.

**Propaganda Campaigns:** Football should just be football. I don't care about overly-emotional player origin stories, or breast cancer awareness or a salute to the troops. I'm here for football and only football.

**Sad appeals to a mass audience:** Look at all of the musicians hired to perform at the Superbowl and how many of those acts actually belong there?  Maroon 5? Really?  In the immortal words of Adam Levine from his critically-acclaimed acne commercial, ""It's nice to feel good.""

**Rule changes / enforcement:** What is a catch? My gripe here has nothing to do with rule changes to protect the health of the players, even if those players don't care much about their own health (everyone knows the risks and no one forces the players to play). It has to do with all of the rest of the bullshit... and then there's refball.  The 2018 season was hilariously bad, with the zebras determining the outcomes of several matches, including the NFC Championship game between the Saints and Rams. Shameful. 

**Failure to adapt:** TV is dying and yet the NFL remains committed to staying there instead of building a worthwhile modern distribution system.  Dat ad revenue, right?  Then there's the lack of improving player armor, or the lack of using technology to reduce the burden on refs (or eliminate them entirely). 

The league makes more money than ever but none of that money is going back into the sport to improve it and extend its dominance as the greatest sport into the 21st century.  Instead, the corpo-drones are content to just phone it in and get paid.  It's disgusting.

&gt;Japan's move comes just in time to capture the growth of the industry. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates that the global monthly audience for esports will reach 385 million by 2022, surpassing even the NFL in the U.S.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cover-Story/Esports-Why-pro-video-gaming-will-be-bigger-than-the-NFL

&gt; In terms of viewership, the big esports events post even more impressive numbers. The 2017 League of Legends world championship, held in Beijing, drew a peak of over 106 million viewers, over 98 percent of whom watched from within China, according to industry analyst Esports Charts. That’s roughly on par with the audience for the 2018 Super Bowl.

&gt; This year’s total DOTA 2 championship audience was roughly the same size as the total number tuning into the Kentucky Derby, and considerably larger than the peak Wimbledon, Daytona 500, U.S. Open or Tour de France audiences.

&gt; While it remains to be seen whether competitive gaming will ever be bigger than the NFL in revenue, the two are running neck-and-neck on a potentially even more important metric: popularity among younger fans. The Post poll found that 38 percent of young Americans identified as fans of esports or competitive gaming, similar to the 40 percent who said they were fans of the NFL.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/27/massive-popularity-esports-charts/

Revenue is not on par yet with major league sports, circling back to what I said before. This is a long haul trend, not a flash in the pan.

Blizzard's gambit has already damaged the game though, if the OWL fails then OW as an esport is dead, same as the HGC. All eggs are in a single basket basically. 

You say the numbers were good based on what? What they say to the public? Yes because it isn't in their best interest to only praise the good points while downplaying the bad. 

8 new teams were added with a higher buy in... so what? We don't know what is going on behind the scenes, there are some reports that some OWL teams did not even pay anything to be a part of the league, and although that huge number is impressive we don't know how they are paying it, what if they pay 1 million a year or 2 million dollars a year? Then it is less impressive. And in regards to Academy, not every team got one. 

Those are two different things, global league means that no matter where they are from they play in a single league. So NA vs EU, CN vs KR it doesn't matter. Venues are the thing that allow you to do home and away games, which is something they have not done yet. And the global league part should work in their favor viewership wise, it's not like there is that huge of a difference between having a global tournament and having a global league, it gets viewers from all over the world in both cases. 

No the highest viewership for OW until that point wasn't 20k, there were multiple tournaments that hit 100k or more and Apex hit 150-200k viewers at one point. 

Not sure why the past tense on ""this was going to fail"", the League is ongoing as you've said more people invested, until they make a profit this isn't over yet, and we haven't even seen home and away games, a bit early to decide it's all worked out. 

How do you know investors are happy? And I have to question what they could be happy with, their OWL brands aren't that huge and they have seen no revenue sharing yet either. ",1548464127,1,1548460527.0,Apex,0.00022478514
4128,3,thoomfish,"My reservations are the same ones I have against all Looter Shooters. Will there be any actual variety to the missions, or are they all going to be mowing down hordes of interchangeable mooks, with a generic mechanic-less boss at the end?

Something I noticed in the last couple videos posted here is that they really like to lean on the ""giant elemental humanoid"" boss archetype. The Ash Titan from yesterday's IGN video, the Fury from this video, and whatever the big thing that showed up at the end was, all look like they were cut from the same cloth.

IMO, in order to not suck, a loot game needs to accomplish two things: First, make the missions actually feel different from each other. Second, give players at endgame reason to run more than whatever the most efficient mission is, over and over.

Destiny failed at both objectives -- the mission design was monotonous, and remember the loot cave? Guild Wars 2 succeeded at the first, but failed at the second -- their philosophy of ""play the content you want to play"" meant basically all rewards were fungible, and so people just farmed the highest reward/hr zone in the game, Silverwastes. That zone was released in 2014, and AFAIK is still the go-to farm spot.

An example of a loot game that (mostly) succeeds is **Monster Hunter**. Different monsters are completely different fights, and the game does a good job of encouraging you to fight a large variety of monsters because each one drops unique parts. It can occasionally devolve into spamming the same fight over and over at end game (see: Apex/140 Rajang Hame runs in MH4U, and Tempered Elder Dragon spam for decoration farming in MHW), but there's plenty of chance to farm other things if you want to, for fashion or variety.",1547744886,1,1547741286.0,Apex,0.0011778853

Building, though, ruins the game for me, personally. I find an exposed player, take a shot and suddenly they're behind a massive tower and it's impossible for me to keep up. I can't build at all and always end up losing when the walls start going up. I know it's a huge draw for Fornite and I'm glad it's there for the thousands of players that enjoy it.

4171,46,Dewdad,"this is the first time I've played a BR game.  Decided to try it out because I'm a HUGE TF2 fan, put in about 150 hours into the game last year and pretty much think it's the best FPS multiplayer game I've ever played and still play it.  Played about 5 matches of this last night, won one of them as the final one alive.  

&amp;#x200B;

First take away, this doesn't feel anything like Titanfall or like it's from the same Dev, this actually looks and feels more like Overwatch and I'm not a big Overwatch player.  I have Overwatch and it can be fun but it doesn't hold a candle to Titanfall 2.  Even the character designs and voices are much more cartoony like other Hero shooters which is a light turn off for me but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Take away two, they incorporated some of the pilot skills from TF2 and made them hero abilities which is cool and helps with the transition from TF2 to Apex.  My personal favorite is the phase shifter.

&amp;#x200B;

Three, having never played a BR game before I'll just say I'm not a big fan of the drop in with nothing and scavenge for gear, it feels more like a survival game.  I much prefer creating a build of sorts and dropping in with your preferred load out and getting right to the action.  I do like the closing circle bringing the action to a head in the final minutes if you make it there.  The respawn stuff works really well and helps with the team dynamic the game set's out to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

I think at the end of the day BR's most likely aren't for me, I have friends that want to try this out so I'll play a little more but I don't think this is something I'll continue to play.

Titanfall is ultimately an arena shooter, similar in some ways to Quake Champions or Lawbreakers. All of these games review well, especially with mouse-based players capable of playing them, but they have a very high skill barrier. Say what you will about the boring process of playing Overwatch with friends and picking a healer every game, but some people can only contribute a lot that way, and it makes the game worth it for them.

Titanfall’s idea of having dumb AI grunts on the map was an interesting one that had a potential to interest more players, but ultimately people end up interfacing the most with the more skilled players; and while I enjoyed Titanfall 2, the very last games I remember were complete shut-outs of 94-500.

They have no trouble drawing the interest of hardcore arena players and their core fans. In order to make Titanfall relevant and deserving of its budget though, they would need some design changes to account for more players. That, or cut back on graphics and lay off half the staff, but I doubt that would lead to a very remarkable product.

Apex does seem like it would at least give the studio more attention, via F2P and no parkour system. I can hope it leads to more Titanfall, but they would need a good way to bring these players over.",1549371691,1,1549368091.0,Apex,0.0005922294

Yeah it's just weird. They probably chose the worst time for Anthem to launch Apex. It's just after its public demo and when the game is in full marketing thrust for launch (I get plenty of ads for it on Youtube) and they kind of stole the gaming media attention from it. Why didn't they wait like 3 weeks or a month after Anthem launch ?

As for BF Battle Royale that's also weird they decide to develop that when they get a dedicated BR game by another studio which is free to play instead of an added mode in BF5 (I guess they can also spin out the mode in a full game).",1549369596,1,1549365996.0,Apex,0.00776792

Blizzard's gambit has already damaged the game though, if the OWL fails then OW as an esport is dead, same as the HGC. All eggs are in a single basket basically. 

You say the numbers were good based on what? What they say to the public? Yes because it isn't in their best interest to only praise the good points while downplaying the bad. 

8 new teams were added with a higher buy in... so what? We don't know what is going on behind the scenes, there are some reports that some OWL teams did not even pay anything to be a part of the league, and although that huge number is impressive we don't know how they are paying it, what if they pay 1 million a year or 2 million dollars a year? Then it is less impressive. And in regards to Academy, not every team got one. 

Those are two different things, global league means that no matter where they are from they play in a single league. So NA vs EU, CN vs KR it doesn't matter. Venues are the thing that allow you to do home and away games, which is something they have not done yet. And the global league part should work in their favor viewership wise, it's not like there is that huge of a difference between having a global tournament and having a global league, it gets viewers from all over the world in both cases. 

No the highest viewership for OW until that point wasn't 20k, there were multiple tournaments that hit 100k or more and Apex hit 150-200k viewers at one point. 

Not sure why the past tense on ""this was going to fail"", the League is ongoing as you've said more people invested, until they make a profit this isn't over yet, and we haven't even seen home and away games, a bit early to decide it's all worked out. 

How do you know investors are happy? And I have to question what they could be happy with, their OWL brands aren't that huge and they have seen no revenue sharing yet either. ",1548464127,1,1548460527.0,Apex,0.00022478514
4228,103,thoomfish,"My reservations are the same ones I have against all Looter Shooters. Will there be any actual variety to the missions, or are they all going to be mowing down hordes of interchangeable mooks, with a generic mechanic-less boss at the end?

Something I noticed in the last couple videos posted here is that they really like to lean on the ""giant elemental humanoid"" boss archetype. The Ash Titan from yesterday's IGN video, the Fury from this video, and whatever the big thing that showed up at the end was, all look like they were cut from the same cloth.

IMO, in order to not suck, a loot game needs to accomplish two things: First, make the missions actually feel different from each other. Second, give players at endgame reason to run more than whatever the most efficient mission is, over and over.

Destiny failed at both objectives -- the mission design was monotonous, and remember the loot cave? Guild Wars 2 succeeded at the first, but failed at the second -- their philosophy of ""play the content you want to play"" meant basically all rewards were fungible, and so people just farmed the highest reward/hr zone in the game, Silverwastes. That zone was released in 2014, and AFAIK is still the go-to farm spot.

An example of a loot game that (mostly) succeeds is **Monster Hunter**. Different monsters are completely different fights, and the game does a good job of encouraging you to fight a large variety of monsters because each one drops unique parts. It can occasionally devolve into spamming the same fight over and over at end game (see: Apex/140 Rajang Hame runs in MH4U, and Tempered Elder Dragon spam for decoration farming in MHW), but there's plenty of chance to farm other things if you want to, for fashion or variety.",1547744886,1,1547741286.0,Apex,0.0011778853

With the respawn system, there's less downtime with Apex than there is in the other popular BRs. There will still be some, but it's a lot more likely that you'll live or die as a squad than it is you'll get picked off and have to wait out the full match.

Building, though, ruins the game for me, personally. I find an exposed player, take a shot and suddenly they're behind a massive tower and it's impossible for me to keep up. I can't build at all and always end up losing when the walls start going up. I know it's a huge draw for Fornite and I'm glad it's there for the thousands of players that enjoy it.

4271,146,Dewdad,"this is the first time I've played a BR game.  Decided to try it out because I'm a HUGE TF2 fan, put in about 150 hours into the game last year and pretty much think it's the best FPS multiplayer game I've ever played and still play it.  Played about 5 matches of this last night, won one of them as the final one alive.  

&amp;#x200B;

First take away, this doesn't feel anything like Titanfall or like it's from the same Dev, this actually looks and feels more like Overwatch and I'm not a big Overwatch player.  I have Overwatch and it can be fun but it doesn't hold a candle to Titanfall 2.  Even the character designs and voices are much more cartoony like other Hero shooters which is a light turn off for me but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Take away two, they incorporated some of the pilot skills from TF2 and made them hero abilities which is cool and helps with the transition from TF2 to Apex.  My personal favorite is the phase shifter.

&amp;#x200B;

Three, having never played a BR game before I'll just say I'm not a big fan of the drop in with nothing and scavenge for gear, it feels more like a survival game.  I much prefer creating a build of sorts and dropping in with your preferred load out and getting right to the action.  I do like the closing circle bringing the action to a head in the final minutes if you make it there.  The respawn stuff works really well and helps with the team dynamic the game set's out to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

I think at the end of the day BR's most likely aren't for me, I have friends that want to try this out so I'll play a little more but I don't think this is something I'll continue to play.

There is a actual legitimate reason why people hate fornite. They have turned it into something much more than it was, but at the outset it was 100% “this Battlegrounds thing seems popular, lets do that too!” And then gave it away for free and geared it more towards children.

Titanfall is ultimately an arena shooter, similar in some ways to Quake Champions or Lawbreakers. All of these games review well, especially with mouse-based players capable of playing them, but they have a very high skill barrier. Say what you will about the boring process of playing Overwatch with friends and picking a healer every game, but some people can only contribute a lot that way, and it makes the game worth it for them.

Titanfall’s idea of having dumb AI grunts on the map was an interesting one that had a potential to interest more players, but ultimately people end up interfacing the most with the more skilled players; and while I enjoyed Titanfall 2, the very last games I remember were complete shut-outs of 94-500.

They have no trouble drawing the interest of hardcore arena players and their core fans. In order to make Titanfall relevant and deserving of its budget though, they would need some design changes to account for more players. That, or cut back on graphics and lay off half the staff, but I doubt that would lead to a very remarkable product.

Apex does seem like it would at least give the studio more attention, via F2P and no parkour system. I can hope it leads to more Titanfall, but they would need a good way to bring these players over.",1549371691,1,1549368091.0,Apex,0.0005922294

Yeah it's just weird. They probably chose the worst time for Anthem to launch Apex. It's just after its public demo and when the game is in full marketing thrust for launch (I get plenty of ads for it on Youtube) and they kind of stole the gaming media attention from it. Why didn't they wait like 3 weeks or a month after Anthem launch ?

Blizzard's gambit has already damaged the game though, if the OWL fails then OW as an esport is dead, same as the HGC. All eggs are in a single basket basically. 

You say the numbers were good based on what? What they say to the public? Yes because it isn't in their best interest to only praise the good points while downplaying the bad. 

8 new teams were added with a higher buy in... so what? We don't know what is going on behind the scenes, there are some reports that some OWL teams did not even pay anything to be a part of the league, and although that huge number is impressive we don't know how they are paying it, what if they pay 1 million a year or 2 million dollars a year? Then it is less impressive. And in regards to Academy, not every team got one. 

Those are two different things, global league means that no matter where they are from they play in a single league. So NA vs EU, CN vs KR it doesn't matter. Venues are the thing that allow you to do home and away games, which is something they have not done yet. And the global league part should work in their favor viewership wise, it's not like there is that huge of a difference between having a global tournament and having a global league, it gets viewers from all over the world in both cases. 

No the highest viewership for OW until that point wasn't 20k, there were multiple tournaments that hit 100k or more and Apex hit 150-200k viewers at one point. 

Not sure why the past tense on ""this was going to fail"", the League is ongoing as you've said more people invested, until they make a profit this isn't over yet, and we haven't even seen home and away games, a bit early to decide it's all worked out. 

How do you know investors are happy? And I have to question what they could be happy with, their OWL brands aren't that huge and they have seen no revenue sharing yet either. ",1548464127,1,1548460527.0,Apex,0.00022478514
4328,203,thoomfish,"My reservations are the same ones I have against all Looter Shooters. Will there be any actual variety to the missions, or are they all going to be mowing down hordes of interchangeable mooks, with a generic mechanic-less boss at the end?

Something I noticed in the last couple videos posted here is that they really like to lean on the ""giant elemental humanoid"" boss archetype. The Ash Titan from yesterday's IGN video, the Fury from this video, and whatever the big thing that showed up at the end was, all look like they were cut from the same cloth.

IMO, in order to not suck, a loot game needs to accomplish two things: First, make the missions actually feel different from each other. Second, give players at endgame reason to run more than whatever the most efficient mission is, over and over.

Destiny failed at both objectives -- the mission design was monotonous, and remember the loot cave? Guild Wars 2 succeeded at the first, but failed at the second -- their philosophy of ""play the content you want to play"" meant basically all rewards were fungible, and so people just farmed the highest reward/hr zone in the game, Silverwastes. That zone was released in 2014, and AFAIK is still the go-to farm spot.

An example of a loot game that (mostly) succeeds is **Monster Hunter**. Different monsters are completely different fights, and the game does a good job of encouraging you to fight a large variety of monsters because each one drops unique parts. It can occasionally devolve into spamming the same fight over and over at end game (see: Apex/140 Rajang Hame runs in MH4U, and Tempered Elder Dragon spam for decoration farming in MHW), but there's plenty of chance to farm other things if you want to, for fashion or variety.",1547744886,1,1547741286.0,Apex,0.0011778853

With the respawn system, there's less downtime with Apex than there is in the other popular BRs. There will still be some, but it's a lot more likely that you'll live or die as a squad than it is you'll get picked off and have to wait out the full match.

Building, though, ruins the game for me, personally. I find an exposed player, take a shot and suddenly they're behind a massive tower and it's impossible for me to keep up. I can't build at all and always end up losing when the walls start going up. I know it's a huge draw for Fornite and I'm glad it's there for the thousands of players that enjoy it.

4371,246,Dewdad,"this is the first time I've played a BR game.  Decided to try it out because I'm a HUGE TF2 fan, put in about 150 hours into the game last year and pretty much think it's the best FPS multiplayer game I've ever played and still play it.  Played about 5 matches of this last night, won one of them as the final one alive.  

&amp;#x200B;

First take away, this doesn't feel anything like Titanfall or like it's from the same Dev, this actually looks and feels more like Overwatch and I'm not a big Overwatch player.  I have Overwatch and it can be fun but it doesn't hold a candle to Titanfall 2.  Even the character designs and voices are much more cartoony like other Hero shooters which is a light turn off for me but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Take away two, they incorporated some of the pilot skills from TF2 and made them hero abilities which is cool and helps with the transition from TF2 to Apex.  My personal favorite is the phase shifter.

&amp;#x200B;

Three, having never played a BR game before I'll just say I'm not a big fan of the drop in with nothing and scavenge for gear, it feels more like a survival game.  I much prefer creating a build of sorts and dropping in with your preferred load out and getting right to the action.  I do like the closing circle bringing the action to a head in the final minutes if you make it there.  The respawn stuff works really well and helps with the team dynamic the game set's out to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

I think at the end of the day BR's most likely aren't for me, I have friends that want to try this out so I'll play a little more but I don't think this is something I'll continue to play.

There is a actual legitimate reason why people hate fornite. They have turned it into something much more than it was, but at the outset it was 100% “this Battlegrounds thing seems popular, lets do that too!” And then gave it away for free and geared it more towards children.

Titanfall is ultimately an arena shooter, similar in some ways to Quake Champions or Lawbreakers. All of these games review well, especially with mouse-based players capable of playing them, but they have a very high skill barrier. Say what you will about the boring process of playing Overwatch with friends and picking a healer every game, but some people can only contribute a lot that way, and it makes the game worth it for them.

Titanfall’s idea of having dumb AI grunts on the map was an interesting one that had a potential to interest more players, but ultimately people end up interfacing the most with the more skilled players; and while I enjoyed Titanfall 2, the very last games I remember were complete shut-outs of 94-500.

They have no trouble drawing the interest of hardcore arena players and their core fans. In order to make Titanfall relevant and deserving of its budget though, they would need some design changes to account for more players. That, or cut back on graphics and lay off half the staff, but I doubt that would lead to a very remarkable product.

Apex does seem like it would at least give the studio more attention, via F2P and no parkour system. I can hope it leads to more Titanfall, but they would need a good way to bring these players over.",1549371691,1,1549368091.0,Apex,0.0005922294

Yeah it's just weird. They probably chose the worst time for Anthem to launch Apex. It's just after its public demo and when the game is in full marketing thrust for launch (I get plenty of ads for it on Youtube) and they kind of stole the gaming media attention from it. Why didn't they wait like 3 weeks or a month after Anthem launch ?

Blizzard's gambit has already damaged the game though, if the OWL fails then OW as an esport is dead, same as the HGC. All eggs are in a single basket basically. 

You say the numbers were good based on what? What they say to the public? Yes because it isn't in their best interest to only praise the good points while downplaying the bad. 

8 new teams were added with a higher buy in... so what? We don't know what is going on behind the scenes, there are some reports that some OWL teams did not even pay anything to be a part of the league, and although that huge number is impressive we don't know how they are paying it, what if they pay 1 million a year or 2 million dollars a year? Then it is less impressive. And in regards to Academy, not every team got one. 

Those are two different things, global league means that no matter where they are from they play in a single league. So NA vs EU, CN vs KR it doesn't matter. Venues are the thing that allow you to do home and away games, which is something they have not done yet. And the global league part should work in their favor viewership wise, it's not like there is that huge of a difference between having a global tournament and having a global league, it gets viewers from all over the world in both cases. 

No the highest viewership for OW until that point wasn't 20k, there were multiple tournaments that hit 100k or more and Apex hit 150-200k viewers at one point. 

Not sure why the past tense on ""this was going to fail"", the League is ongoing as you've said more people invested, until they make a profit this isn't over yet, and we haven't even seen home and away games, a bit early to decide it's all worked out. 

How do you know investors are happy? And I have to question what they could be happy with, their OWL brands aren't that huge and they have seen no revenue sharing yet either. ",1548464127,1,1548460527.0,Apex,0.00022478514
4428,303,thoomfish,"My reservations are the same ones I have against all Looter Shooters. Will there be any actual variety to the missions, or are they all going to be mowing down hordes of interchangeable mooks, with a generic mechanic-less boss at the end?

Something I noticed in the last couple videos posted here is that they really like to lean on the ""giant elemental humanoid"" boss archetype. The Ash Titan from yesterday's IGN video, the Fury from this video, and whatever the big thing that showed up at the end was, all look like they were cut from the same cloth.

IMO, in order to not suck, a loot game needs to accomplish two things: First, make the missions actually feel different from each other. Second, give players at endgame reason to run more than whatever the most efficient mission is, over and over.

Destiny failed at both objectives -- the mission design was monotonous, and remember the loot cave? Guild Wars 2 succeeded at the first, but failed at the second -- their philosophy of ""play the content you want to play"" meant basically all rewards were fungible, and so people just farmed the highest reward/hr zone in the game, Silverwastes. That zone was released in 2014, and AFAIK is still the go-to farm spot.

An example of a loot game that (mostly) succeeds is **Monster Hunter**. Different monsters are completely different fights, and the game does a good job of encouraging you to fight a large variety of monsters because each one drops unique parts. It can occasionally devolve into spamming the same fight over and over at end game (see: Apex/140 Rajang Hame runs in MH4U, and Tempered Elder Dragon spam for decoration farming in MHW), but there's plenty of chance to farm other things if you want to, for fashion or variety.",1547744886,1,1547741286.0,Apex,0.0011778853

With the respawn system, there's less downtime with Apex than there is in the other popular BRs. There will still be some, but it's a lot more likely that you'll live or die as a squad than it is you'll get picked off and have to wait out the full match.

Building, though, ruins the game for me, personally. I find an exposed player, take a shot and suddenly they're behind a massive tower and it's impossible for me to keep up. I can't build at all and always end up losing when the walls start going up. I know it's a huge draw for Fornite and I'm glad it's there for the thousands of players that enjoy it.

4471,346,Dewdad,"this is the first time I've played a BR game.  Decided to try it out because I'm a HUGE TF2 fan, put in about 150 hours into the game last year and pretty much think it's the best FPS multiplayer game I've ever played and still play it.  Played about 5 matches of this last night, won one of them as the final one alive.  

&amp;#x200B;

First take away, this doesn't feel anything like Titanfall or like it's from the same Dev, this actually looks and feels more like Overwatch and I'm not a big Overwatch player.  I have Overwatch and it can be fun but it doesn't hold a candle to Titanfall 2.  Even the character designs and voices are much more cartoony like other Hero shooters which is a light turn off for me but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Take away two, they incorporated some of the pilot skills from TF2 and made them hero abilities which is cool and helps with the transition from TF2 to Apex.  My personal favorite is the phase shifter.

&amp;#x200B;

Three, having never played a BR game before I'll just say I'm not a big fan of the drop in with nothing and scavenge for gear, it feels more like a survival game.  I much prefer creating a build of sorts and dropping in with your preferred load out and getting right to the action.  I do like the closing circle bringing the action to a head in the final minutes if you make it there.  The respawn stuff works really well and helps with the team dynamic the game set's out to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

I think at the end of the day BR's most likely aren't for me, I have friends that want to try this out so I'll play a little more but I don't think this is something I'll continue to play.

A game that was in development hell for almost a decade, and came out and was so awful, that it was basically DOA. Everyone hated it. Then they saw how successful Battlegrounds was and since they already had a working relationship with them, they quickly turned around and turned it into a clone copy of that game (I want to say it had a development of two months). There is a actual legitimate reason why people hate fornite. They have turned it into something much more than it was, but at the outset it was 100% “this Battlegrounds thing seems popular, lets do that too!” And then gave it away for free and geared it more towards children.

Titanfall is ultimately an arena shooter, similar in some ways to Quake Champions or Lawbreakers. All of these games review well, especially with mouse-based players capable of playing them, but they have a very high skill barrier. Say what you will about the boring process of playing Overwatch with friends and picking a healer every game, but some people can only contribute a lot that way, and it makes the game worth it for them.

Titanfall’s idea of having dumb AI grunts on the map was an interesting one that had a potential to interest more players, but ultimately people end up interfacing the most with the more skilled players; and while I enjoyed Titanfall 2, the very last games I remember were complete shut-outs of 94-500.

They have no trouble drawing the interest of hardcore arena players and their core fans. In order to make Titanfall relevant and deserving of its budget though, they would need some design changes to account for more players. That, or cut back on graphics and lay off half the staff, but I doubt that would lead to a very remarkable product.

Apex does seem like it would at least give the studio more attention, via F2P and no parkour system. I can hope it leads to more Titanfall, but they would need a good way to bring these players over.",1549371691,1,1549368091.0,Apex,0.0005922294

Yeah it's just weird. They probably chose the worst time for Anthem to launch Apex. It's just after its public demo and when the game is in full marketing thrust for launch (I get plenty of ads for it on Youtube) and they kind of stole the gaming media attention from it. Why didn't they wait like 3 weeks or a month after Anthem launch ?

Blizzard's gambit has already damaged the game though, if the OWL fails then OW as an esport is dead, same as the HGC. All eggs are in a single basket basically. 

You say the numbers were good based on what? What they say to the public? Yes because it isn't in their best interest to only praise the good points while downplaying the bad. 

8 new teams were added with a higher buy in... so what? We don't know what is going on behind the scenes, there are some reports that some OWL teams did not even pay anything to be a part of the league, and although that huge number is impressive we don't know how they are paying it, what if they pay 1 million a year or 2 million dollars a year? Then it is less impressive. And in regards to Academy, not every team got one. 

Those are two different things, global league means that no matter where they are from they play in a single league. So NA vs EU, CN vs KR it doesn't matter. Venues are the thing that allow you to do home and away games, which is something they have not done yet. And the global league part should work in their favor viewership wise, it's not like there is that huge of a difference between having a global tournament and having a global league, it gets viewers from all over the world in both cases. 

No the highest viewership for OW until that point wasn't 20k, there were multiple tournaments that hit 100k or more and Apex hit 150-200k viewers at one point. 

Not sure why the past tense on ""this was going to fail"", the League is ongoing as you've said more people invested, until they make a profit this isn't over yet, and we haven't even seen home and away games, a bit early to decide it's all worked out. 

How do you know investors are happy? And I have to question what they could be happy with, their OWL brands aren't that huge and they have seen no revenue sharing yet either. ",1548464127,1,1548460527.0,Apex,0.00022478514
4528,403,thoomfish,"My reservations are the same ones I have against all Looter Shooters. Will there be any actual variety to the missions, or are they all going to be mowing down hordes of interchangeable mooks, with a generic mechanic-less boss at the end?

Something I noticed in the last couple videos posted here is that they really like to lean on the ""giant elemental humanoid"" boss archetype. The Ash Titan from yesterday's IGN video, the Fury from this video, and whatever the big thing that showed up at the end was, all look like they were cut from the same cloth.

IMO, in order to not suck, a loot game needs to accomplish two things: First, make the missions actually feel different from each other. Second, give players at endgame reason to run more than whatever the most efficient mission is, over and over.

Destiny failed at both objectives -- the mission design was monotonous, and remember the loot cave? Guild Wars 2 succeeded at the first, but failed at the second -- their philosophy of ""play the content you want to play"" meant basically all rewards were fungible, and so people just farmed the highest reward/hr zone in the game, Silverwastes. That zone was released in 2014, and AFAIK is still the go-to farm spot.

An example of a loot game that (mostly) succeeds is **Monster Hunter**. Different monsters are completely different fights, and the game does a good job of encouraging you to fight a large variety of monsters because each one drops unique parts. It can occasionally devolve into spamming the same fight over and over at end game (see: Apex/140 Rajang Hame runs in MH4U, and Tempered Elder Dragon spam for decoration farming in MHW), but there's plenty of chance to farm other things if you want to, for fashion or variety.",1547744886,1,1547741286.0,Apex,0.0011778853

With the respawn system, there's less downtime with Apex than there is in the other popular BRs. There will still be some, but it's a lot more likely that you'll live or die as a squad than it is you'll get picked off and have to wait out the full match.

Building, though, ruins the game for me, personally. I find an exposed player, take a shot and suddenly they're behind a massive tower and it's impossible for me to keep up. I can't build at all and always end up losing when the walls start going up. I know it's a huge draw for Fornite and I'm glad it's there for the thousands of players that enjoy it.

4571,446,Dewdad,"this is the first time I've played a BR game.  Decided to try it out because I'm a HUGE TF2 fan, put in about 150 hours into the game last year and pretty much think it's the best FPS multiplayer game I've ever played and still play it.  Played about 5 matches of this last night, won one of them as the final one alive.  

&amp;#x200B;

First take away, this doesn't feel anything like Titanfall or like it's from the same Dev, this actually looks and feels more like Overwatch and I'm not a big Overwatch player.  I have Overwatch and it can be fun but it doesn't hold a candle to Titanfall 2.  Even the character designs and voices are much more cartoony like other Hero shooters which is a light turn off for me but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Take away two, they incorporated some of the pilot skills from TF2 and made them hero abilities which is cool and helps with the transition from TF2 to Apex.  My personal favorite is the phase shifter.

&amp;#x200B;

Three, having never played a BR game before I'll just say I'm not a big fan of the drop in with nothing and scavenge for gear, it feels more like a survival game.  I much prefer creating a build of sorts and dropping in with your preferred load out and getting right to the action.  I do like the closing circle bringing the action to a head in the final minutes if you make it there.  The respawn stuff works really well and helps with the team dynamic the game set's out to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

I think at the end of the day BR's most likely aren't for me, I have friends that want to try this out so I'll play a little more but I don't think this is something I'll continue to play.

A game that was in development hell for almost a decade, and came out and was so awful, that it was basically DOA. Everyone hated it. Then they saw how successful Battlegrounds was and since they already had a working relationship with them, they quickly turned around and turned it into a clone copy of that game (I want to say it had a development of two months). There is a actual legitimate reason why people hate fornite. They have turned it into something much more than it was, but at the outset it was 100% “this Battlegrounds thing seems popular, lets do that too!” And then gave it away for free and geared it more towards children.

Titanfall is ultimately an arena shooter, similar in some ways to Quake Champions or Lawbreakers. All of these games review well, especially with mouse-based players capable of playing them, but they have a very high skill barrier. Say what you will about the boring process of playing Overwatch with friends and picking a healer every game, but some people can only contribute a lot that way, and it makes the game worth it for them.

Titanfall’s idea of having dumb AI grunts on the map was an interesting one that had a potential to interest more players, but ultimately people end up interfacing the most with the more skilled players; and while I enjoyed Titanfall 2, the very last games I remember were complete shut-outs of 94-500.

They have no trouble drawing the interest of hardcore arena players and their core fans. In order to make Titanfall relevant and deserving of its budget though, they would need some design changes to account for more players. That, or cut back on graphics and lay off half the staff, but I doubt that would lead to a very remarkable product.

Apex does seem like it would at least give the studio more attention, via F2P and no parkour system. I can hope it leads to more Titanfall, but they would need a good way to bring these players over.",1549371691,1,1549368091.0,Apex,0.0005922294

Yeah it's just weird. They probably chose the worst time for Anthem to launch Apex. It's just after its public demo and when the game is in full marketing thrust for launch (I get plenty of ads for it on Youtube) and they kind of stole the gaming media attention from it. Why didn't they wait like 3 weeks or a month after Anthem launch ?

Blizzard's gambit has already damaged the game though, if the OWL fails then OW as an esport is dead, same as the HGC. All eggs are in a single basket basically. 

You say the numbers were good based on what? What they say to the public? Yes because it isn't in their best interest to only praise the good points while downplaying the bad. 

8 new teams were added with a higher buy in... so what? We don't know what is going on behind the scenes, there are some reports that some OWL teams did not even pay anything to be a part of the league, and although that huge number is impressive we don't know how they are paying it, what if they pay 1 million a year or 2 million dollars a year? Then it is less impressive. And in regards to Academy, not every team got one. 

Those are two different things, global league means that no matter where they are from they play in a single league. So NA vs EU, CN vs KR it doesn't matter. Venues are the thing that allow you to do home and away games, which is something they have not done yet. And the global league part should work in their favor viewership wise, it's not like there is that huge of a difference between having a global tournament and having a global league, it gets viewers from all over the world in both cases. 

No the highest viewership for OW until that point wasn't 20k, there were multiple tournaments that hit 100k or more and Apex hit 150-200k viewers at one point. 

Not sure why the past tense on ""this was going to fail"", the League is ongoing as you've said more people invested, until they make a profit this isn't over yet, and we haven't even seen home and away games, a bit early to decide it's all worked out. 

How do you know investors are happy? And I have to question what they could be happy with, their OWL brands aren't that huge and they have seen no revenue sharing yet either. ",1548464127,1,1548460527.0,Apex,0.00022478514
4628,503,thoomfish,"My reservations are the same ones I have against all Looter Shooters. Will there be any actual variety to the missions, or are they all going to be mowing down hordes of interchangeable mooks, with a generic mechanic-less boss at the end?

Something I noticed in the last couple videos posted here is that they really like to lean on the ""giant elemental humanoid"" boss archetype. The Ash Titan from yesterday's IGN video, the Fury from this video, and whatever the big thing that showed up at the end was, all look like they were cut from the same cloth.

IMO, in order to not suck, a loot game needs to accomplish two things: First, make the missions actually feel different from each other. Second, give players at endgame reason to run more than whatever the most efficient mission is, over and over.

Destiny failed at both objectives -- the mission design was monotonous, and remember the loot cave? Guild Wars 2 succeeded at the first, but failed at the second -- their philosophy of ""play the content you want to play"" meant basically all rewards were fungible, and so people just farmed the highest reward/hr zone in the game, Silverwastes. That zone was released in 2014, and AFAIK is still the go-to farm spot.

An example of a loot game that (mostly) succeeds is **Monster Hunter**. Different monsters are completely different fights, and the game does a good job of encouraging you to fight a large variety of monsters because each one drops unique parts. It can occasionally devolve into spamming the same fight over and over at end game (see: Apex/140 Rajang Hame runs in MH4U, and Tempered Elder Dragon spam for decoration farming in MHW), but there's plenty of chance to farm other things if you want to, for fashion or variety.",1547744886,1,1547741286.0,Apex,0.0011778853

With the respawn system, there's less downtime with Apex than there is in the other popular BRs. There will still be some, but it's a lot more likely that you'll live or die as a squad than it is you'll get picked off and have to wait out the full match.

I can't build at all and always end up losing when the walls start going up. I know it's a huge draw for Fornite and I'm glad it's there for the thousands of players that enjoy it.

4671,546,Dewdad,"this is the first time I've played a BR game.  Decided to try it out because I'm a HUGE TF2 fan, put in about 150 hours into the game last year and pretty much think it's the best FPS multiplayer game I've ever played and still play it.  Played about 5 matches of this last night, won one of them as the final one alive.  

&amp;#x200B;

First take away, this doesn't feel anything like Titanfall or like it's from the same Dev, this actually looks and feels more like Overwatch and I'm not a big Overwatch player.  I have Overwatch and it can be fun but it doesn't hold a candle to Titanfall 2.  Even the character designs and voices are much more cartoony like other Hero shooters which is a light turn off for me but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Take away two, they incorporated some of the pilot skills from TF2 and made them hero abilities which is cool and helps with the transition from TF2 to Apex.  My personal favorite is the phase shifter.

&amp;#x200B;

Three, having never played a BR game before I'll just say I'm not a big fan of the drop in with nothing and scavenge for gear, it feels more like a survival game.  I much prefer creating a build of sorts and dropping in with your preferred load out and getting right to the action.  I do like the closing circle bringing the action to a head in the final minutes if you make it there.  The respawn stuff works really well and helps with the team dynamic the game set's out to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

I think at the end of the day BR's most likely aren't for me, I have friends that want to try this out so I'll play a little more but I don't think this is something I'll continue to play.

There is a actual legitimate reason why people hate fornite.

Titanfall is ultimately an arena shooter, similar in some ways to Quake Champions or Lawbreakers. All of these games review well, especially with mouse-based players capable of playing them, but they have a very high skill barrier. Say what you will about the boring process of playing Overwatch with friends and picking a healer every game, but some people can only contribute a lot that way, and it makes the game worth it for them.

Titanfall’s idea of having dumb AI grunts on the map was an interesting one that had a potential to interest more players, but ultimately people end up interfacing the most with the more skilled players; and while I enjoyed Titanfall 2, the very last games I remember were complete shut-outs of 94-500.

They have no trouble drawing the interest of hardcore arena players and their core fans. In order to make Titanfall relevant and deserving of its budget though, they would need some design changes to account for more players. That, or cut back on graphics and lay off half the staff, but I doubt that would lead to a very remarkable product.

Apex does seem like it would at least give the studio more attention, via F2P and no parkour system. I can hope it leads to more Titanfall, but they would need a good way to bring these players over.",1549371691,1,1549368091.0,Apex,0.0005922294

Yeah it's just weird. They probably chose the worst time for Anthem to launch Apex. It's just after its public demo and when the game is in full marketing thrust for launch (I get plenty of ads for it on Youtube) and they kind of stole the gaming media attention from it. Why didn't they wait like 3 weeks or a month after Anthem launch ?

As for BF Battle Royale that's also weird they decide to develop that when they get a dedicated BR game by another studio which is free to play instead of an added mode in BF5 (I guess they can also spin out the mode in a full game).",1549369596,1,1549365996.0,Apex,0.00776792

the major fucky problems of the game being practically unplayable should have been addressed far earlier than a public preorder demo going out.

there is no excuse for these games of this level of budget to constantly release as broken as they are, and this seems like it might follow the same trend of fallout 76 and battlefield v in this regard.

They did phamaceuticals, making both viruses and antidotes. Their cash cow were Bio Organic Weapons (B.O.W.s). The tyrant at end of re1 was a prototype, they basically found three ways to make a tyrant and control it, with the idea being it'd be the perfect battlefield soldier. 

First: t103 (mr x, re2). That suit he wears is a controller and dampener that stops mutations from it losing higher brain power functions. 

Second: Nemesis Parasite (made by paris division). Basically made the tyrant extremely resilient and also increased higher brain power. Susceptible to suggestions and control. 

Third: T.A.L.O.S.  basically metal gear tyrant. Made in arklay, secured and removed before the city was destroyed. Huge SAM rockets on each arm, more computer than creature.

If a game underperforms like Battlefield V it is then 'uplifted', first to the company distribution which then if there's a need might redistribute the copy to other stores running low.

If a game drastically underperforms it is then uplifted to the wholesaler who then sells it on to 'alternate' stores which typically don't have games like poundland who'll sell a game for a fiver.

If a game does so poorly that it isn't uplifted to either company distribution or wholessales then that's really bad it basically means they don't see these copies selling for even the cost of transportation and storage so the game gets basically written off and it's upto each store on how to get rid of it most will probably reduce it to 90% off.

4756,30,ahrzal,"I liked the video, but most of the ""important factors"" are the same for any game. The key one is Overwatch -- make the movement simple to understand and pull off, with room to master. 

People *always* bring up the good ol' days of arena shooters (or ""movement shooters""...whatever) of the late 90's/early 2000's. Quake, UT, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Tribes, etc. The common thinking is that those games were the blueprint and we've strayed too far from that blueprint. I don't think its that simple. Those games were immensely popular but they were also immensely challenging to new players. How could that be? Choice -- or, lack thereof. Back in those days, the # of multiplayer shooters out there were small. Not only that, the first big ones were Arena shooters (for the most part). When you said shooter, people instantly thought of Quake or UT99.

The fact that these type of shooters are multiplayer makes the learning curve that much worse. People who enjoy multiplayer games *usually* have a competitive streak in them. If you play games to have fun, it simply isn't fun to start playing a new game and get trashed over and over and over ad nauseum. These issues are compounded with movement based shooters, because it's not just that you couldn't physically aim at them fast enough, it's that they're now running and jumping all around you. It's overwhelming. You feel helpless. What do people do nowadays? They move on to the next big shooter that probably just released in the past month or two. I love ""movement shooters,"" but I even experienced this when I tried to get back into Titanfall 2. Generally, I'm good at FPS games. I felt completely useless on the battlefield. People were flying around, flicking me like crazy and generally just dumpstering me. I would play for an hour and leave frustrated. So I uninstalled it. 

But then, why was the recent Doom reboot popular? Why are difficult games like Dark Souls popular? Because they're single player. I can get wrecked by a boss for an hour in Dark Souls, or continue to die in Doom, but you know what happens? I win. I beat it. I get the feeling of progress and success without the competitive edge making every death sting. 

I honestly don't know how to make multiplayer pure ""movement based"" shooters popular for anything past their launch window. The meatgrinder that new players go through is just too much to overcome. Overwatch avoided this with balance. You can play characters with more health, or ways to negate movement -- when you do try to get into the movement aspect of the game, it's easy and intuitive (looking at you bunny hop). If the games feedback loop is too negative for too long in the beginning, it's going to turn players off. Just the fact of the matter. ",1548951018,13,1548947418.0,Battlefield,0.5224161

4761,35,AlternateTimeline_,"Battlefield 4 released on PS4 with a weird rubber banding effect that most agreed was caused by a lack of server resources. Every 3 or 4 seconds you would jerk backwards. Bullets fired vanished, you would suddenly die without being shot, vehicles would bounce around and be impossible to use properly, helicopters were impossible to fly, it was a total mess. The game was basically unplayable for almost an entire year with some maps suffering more than others.

Then, they announced the ""rent a server"" program where players would pay for servers instead of EA and literally the moment that the program went live the rubber banding vanished.

So EA spent an entire year refusing to pay for adequate servers for their biggest game during the launch year of the PS4 and only when the players began to pay for the servers did they open it up and give us servers that worked. 

During this whole time they kept posting ""gee we don't know, it's super weird guys, we're totally investigating, we'll get back to you!"" when the entire time they knew *exactly* what the problem was and refused to solve it.

So EA coming out here and saying that this was unexpected, that they don't know what's causing it or that they couldn't see this problem before a large population played? Yea.. bullshit. They don't like to pay for servers, it's as simple as that. They want to sell a product and then not deliver what you paid for. 

And I'll also add here for anyone that read this far, stay the fuck away from this game until it proves itself. EA have already admitted that the ""economy"" has been changed for the demo. You know what that means; microtransactions out the ass. In game there is already obvious real money shops everywhere.

It always seemed weird what kind of relationship those two companies really had, and reading about it being basically the opposite (Overkill in control of Starbreeze) of what you would've expecteded based off the assumption that Overkill was the developing company and Starbreeze controlled everything, gave Overkill at least several opportunities to use Starbreeze as a punching bag and turn a bad situation into somewhat of a PR success.",1548684221,11,1548680621.0,Battlefield,0.36639872

4773,47,iTomes,"&gt; Did you even read a single article regarding this ranking? For BFV digital sales were not counted.

Did you even read the article you yourself posted? PC digital sales were not counted, not digital sales as a whole. As it stands the game is behind several console exclusive releases where digital sales are counted on both ends, with physical sales added on PC as a bonus. On top of that it's a mere two spots ahead of Call of Duty: WWII which also didn't have its PC digital sales counted and behind FIFA (also had no digital PC sales counted) which has a consistently weak showing in the US compared to other regions. It's also not in the top 10 games worldwide by [revenue](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/64534/top-10-premium-games-2018-revenue/index.html), further indicating a poor reception. And lastly, Battlefield 1 was on second place in its release year despite also not counting digital PC sales, so unless the market drastically changed since then we have a fairly solid benchmark here to showcase what a game that actually sells really well with those restrictions should look like.

Ultimately, there is no real evidence to indicate that digital sales on PC are somehow enough to make a convincing argument that the game didn't sell poorly. It's one platform that isn't particularly huge in the US, it seems very unlikely that it made that much of a difference, especially when other games that are known to have sold well have shown themselves to be competitive in the rankings while also not counting these sales.",1548239840,9,1548236240.0,Battlefield,0.0004640854

4790,64,ChunkyThePotato,"&gt; I don't understand your Civ 5 example because I just downloaded it after not playing it in years and I still have save files.

Ok, I'll show you proof then: 

To make it work, you have to go into the manual save area (not quick save) and specifically select Steam Cloud. It's not automatic. You have to go into the menus of the game and specifically save to the cloud. This is one example of how implementations between different games (even just on Steam alone!) can differ. You never know for sure if all your saves are in the cloud unless you dig through every single one of your games' menus and verify. Not as simple as Xbox.

&gt; I don't buy any game made by EA so I have no idea about Battlefield, and as far as I know Battlefield is almost entirely focused on online multiplayer (which you don't have to pay extra for on PC btw) so I would assume all that is stored on servers.

It still has a singleplayer that would rely on cloud saves. I just used that as an example because it's only available on a separate client, and you have to figure out if that client supports cloud saves or not, and how they work. Not as simple as Xbox.

&gt; Subnautica is your actual first good example because you're right it just doesn't support steam cloud saves because the developers can't get the save files to fit within Valves file size limitations. Which is a shame.

So we agree here. The fact that not every game supports cloud saves adds to the complexity. Not as simple as Xbox.

(And yeah, cloud saves work normally with Subnautica on Xbox lol)

&gt; Cloud saves have been a thing on PC for a very long time now, and it has always been free.

Its audience is far larger than that of Anthem and because players haven't paid for the game, they will be more likely to pay for cosmetics. The production costs of Anthem will be far higher than Dota too, not to mention releasing on three different platforms.

Battlefield is failing to retain players because of the lack of new content which is slow because they have no income after release due to not have microtransactions or any form of DLC/expansions.

Have you played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and thought, ""How about instead of a ship on the seven seas, it's a ship in space!"" for space combat? If so, then this is the game for you! No 3D fighting design, just target and fire! In all seriousness, despite how weird that sounds, it actually works for the game. You to select your type of ship, broadside weapons, turrets, etc. and retrofit your ship the way you want it. The story is okay but the large worlds you travel around are great! There is no landing/planet-side action, just all space ship combat. Sometimes you get a distress signal that's a trap and you have to fight your way out of it. Other times you get pulled out of hyperspace by a giant ship and when the AI says ""Threat Level: RED"", you move your ass out of there as fast as possible.

Overall, the game is great. The AI/enemies can get a little cheezy at times - fights that you should win get you obliterated while other times you take on enemies like a pro. Another bonus is the music - it's all old-time twangy rock songs; very reminiscent of Firefly but a little down 'n dirtier. If you're looking for something different, watch some youtube videos to get an idea of it and give it a shot!

\*\*Star Wars - Battlefront 2 (2018)\*\*

Ok...so...

Let's get one thing clear here...I really want to love DICE Battlefield games. I mean, I do, I really do. I've played every Battlefield since Battlefield 2142 (where I fell in love with the series). They can be some really fun, beautiful games, stuffed with amazing settings and battle moments. Battlefront 2 is no exception...it is a gorgeous game that really shows off the visuals of Star Wars never really shown in a video game. The settings look movie-quality, the effects are amazing, and the music is stellar. That being said there's still an unmistakable issue here that follows DICE games like a voodoo curse...

Matchmaking/Team-Balancing.

 I can't tell you how many times I've been apart of a group where we were 4 players down, only to have an incoming player go to the other time, because you know, they were missing one more player and \*that's\* not very fair of their almost-full-team so send him over! Then people on your team quit because why stick around to get slaughtered with what precious free time you have in life? I have full-time job, an infant, etc - my free time is valuable. Why go through that?

You know what's really fun about DICE games? Knowing whether you won or lost the round barely five. minutes. in. No joke, this is something Battlefield/Battlefront players know all too well. I mean, how do game designers like DICE do that? It's like you actually have to TRY to get teams to be that lop-sided for these astronomically awful rounds. It's mind-boggling how far we are in these franchises and DICE still CANNOT get team-balancing and matchmaking right.

So Battlefront 2, like all DICE games, is an amazing game...when everything lines up just right. When it doesn't, even when it's just a little bit off, you'll find yourself rage-quitting and playing another game that actually WANTS you to be competitive with each other, instead of creating farming teams to get as much XP as possible in a round or whatever sociopathic medals/challenges they invent for you to get a gun skin because why have the player just buy it when he can kill 20 people in a round with a 3-bullet pistol to get a stupid different color?

So yeah, I'll give the game a 7 out of 10, but it's sliding to a 6. The unlocking system is actually okay. Getting destroyed 3 rounds in a row because you ended up on the ""wrong"" team...not so much.",1548121520,7,1548117920.0,Battlefield,0.9561968

4795,69,Iosis,"I do want to note that I'm not at all going to encourage anyone to preorder this. Even outside of the usual ""never preorder games"" thing (a rule I break all the time myself), this *is* still Bioware/EA we're talking about, and even when Bioware's at their best, it's like a 50/50 shot whether this game is going to be ""pretty good"" or ""absolutely awful.""

&gt;So the first one, and one of the most important for me, is the build choices.

Well, to start with, I'll note that I was comparing it to Destiny 2, where you're pretty locked down when it comes to build choices. As you noticed, when you pick a subclass, you then really just pick one cluster of pre-chosen abilities within that subclass. You don't have a lot of freedom there. Anthem has more freedom than that, but I don't want to suggest it has a huge and deep wealth of options (mostly because I have no idea what the full game will offer). It allows more freedom than Destiny 2, but so did Destiny 1.

As for how it all actually works, the only video I can find is [extremely long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhNaLyycPN0), but to summarize what I remember, it basically comes down to the fact that almost all of your gear in Anthem directly relates to your abilities. Each javelin has four active ability slots and like six or seven options for each slot (many of which haven't been shown off yet), and then the gear you equip modifies those abilities further. It remains to be seen how much those modifications matter and how many viable loadouts there really are, but that definitely seems more fun to play around with than Destiny 2's loadouts, at least for me.

&gt;I'll state crudely that Destiny 2's classes for me were basically: Warrior (Tank) / Rogue(Agile DPS) / Mage(Support). Aren't Anthems classes pretty much just that, too?

That's not all that true in Destiny 2. Ultimately, the classes *look* like they're Warrior, Rogue, and Mage, but in the end they all play fairly similarly. Each one is exactly as good with guns as everyone else (which I actually think it smart in an FPS game--it'd suck to be the class that sucks with guns), and each one can build to be just as durable or mobile as any of the others. They all have subclasses that have strong offensive/DPS abilities and support/crowd control abilities. And ultimately, the times when your class (or rather subclass) really feels unique is when you use your super--and even then, the majority of supers are ""do a lot of damage to one enemy or a bunch of enemies,"" with only a couple of exceptions for each class.

To put it another way, there really isn't a tank class in Destiny 2. The Warlock does have the strongest support super as of Forsaken and the only real support-focused subclass build (the Dawnblade's ""Attunement of Grace"" build), but that's the closest anyone comes to really being a support class.

The things that make Anthem look like it has better niches for classes to me are:

* The combo system. This is something Bioware has used in all of their games since Mass Effect 2, actually. Classes have a certain range of effects they can use to set up combos and effects they can use to ""detonate"" those combos. Because no class or build can really cover all of the options, that helps encourage teamwork between classes, which I like.
* Anthem's classes all *move* differently, and in more ways than just jumping (which is how Destiny 2's classes feel most different). There's no class in Destiny 2 that's like Anthem's Colossus, for example, where you're this huge, hulking metal suit that just has a ton of health and no shields. That's wildly different from the Storm, who has a tiny health pool but a lot of shields and can fly above the battlefield almost indefinitely. That degree of difference doesn't happen in Destiny.
* This part actually concerns me a little, but each javelin also seems to have a different focus when it comes to what kind of guns they use. I don't know for sure--it's been a while since I've checked in on what kind of gear each javelin can use--but it does seem like there are weapon types that, say, only the Colossus can use, or only the Interceptor. If that's balanced well, it's a good way to differentiate them; if it's balanced poorly, it's going to be very frustrating (which is why Destiny 2 doesn't have any weapon restrictions on classes at all).

I'll note that part of the reason Anthem's javelins can be so different from one another is that Anthem has no PvP at all. Destiny 2 has to be balanced for PvP, so they can't give players abilities that would suck to have used against you, and they can't design a class around a core concept that would be awful in PvP (like the Storm's focus on hovering over the battlefield would just make them a huge, glowing target in PvP). When the game is PvE-only, there's a lot more freedom to allow things to kinda go nuts in terms of what players are allowed to do.",1548169756,6,1548166156.0,Battlefield,0.015285003

* Interceptor: similar to the Ranger (maybe too similar). Focused on speed. You do feel VERY agile in this one. Its melee strike is really powerful and you can execute it successively pretty quickly. If you've played a Hunter in Destiny, it's kind of like that.
* Colossus: I think there's a huge skill ceiling with this Javelin. Higher risk but higher reward. It's not nearly as agile as the others, and its shield is OFF by default. You have to hit your ""dodge"" button to pull it out. Your melee abilities are powerful but slow. The (default?) Ultimate ability feels REALLY powerful. I feel like this will be the hardest Javelin to be proficient with.
* Storm: I suspect this will be the most popular Javelin. It's pretty awesome to be able to hover above the battlefield and rain down elemental attacks. I felt by far the most powerful in this Javelin. I slotted two shield boosts and never really felt in danger, meanwhile my offensive power was just insane.

I'd argue it forces people to 'hold their ground' a lot more. I'm not if that's what you mean here as well. I simultaneously notice that close quarters fights turn into a more cod esque sprayfest. While long range fights are often just prone battles and ""who moves first loses"".  

It's also highly encouraged people to ""stick together"" which has only amplified a increasingly more common problem in bf games of spawning these giant ""zerg balls"" where you have 80% of a team running around together capping flag after flag.

That being said, I've never played 76, but the bugs that were RE introduced just fucking break it.

I mean, use a game like Borderlands 2 as an example where duping was pretty much a feature and helped people get through the grind of killing Raid Bosses, you know, NPCs, and compare that instead to using those same broken ass guns and equipment IN MULTIPLAYER.

Yeah. BF4 was unstable, buggy, ugly, and then they ported it over to the goddamn next gen games instead of waiting, like, a month?

I mean, not only did they wait, they didn't fix ANY of the issues from launch a whole month later.

Now, Bethesda DID fix the glitches and bugs, BUT REINTRODUCED THEM.

Okay I'm siding with F76 being the worst fucking launch ever now.

Dice and EA did fix BF4, and now that it's stable I can fondly look back on that game and say that it was very good after launch. Of course it took about 6 months from what I remember to fix absolutely everything, but the game was damn excellent after the patch.

If Bethesda fixes the game now, and I mean EVERYTHING, you still have a game that a lot of people enjoy despite it's downfalls. Mainly speaking, the lack of NPCs and story from what I've heard.

It wouldn't be a bad game at all.

But all of Bethesdas incompetence leads me to believe that 6 months would be the minimum amount of time. That it'll get hot patched but mainly remain a broken, duct taped together, dripping mess for a good 8-12 months post launch at best until Bethesda actually manages to fix this shit.

Picked it up for $5 on PC. Have to say I'm having more fun with this, than, say, Battlefield. And I have played almost every BF game except for 5 (yet). I do prefer the more casual approach.

It is not without its issues though. 

Underleveled players will get curb-stomped by those with better star cards and weapons w/mods. I would honestly prefer if everything is already unlocked and given a single level, since some firefights bordered on ""Oh, he had higher health and faster recharge than my guy.""

I also just finished the campaign today.

Do you think when the game's trailer was first revealed, the writers were sweating bullets when they saw so many ""I hope the protagonist doesn't do the predictable thing"" comments?

But besides that, what hurt more about the story is that the plot doesn't take time to breath with its character development. Luke Skywalker and Del's stage fits well, but most other stages felt like filler until Jakku.

4816,90,PlatinumWalrus,"&gt; There are numerous layers on top of the basic combat mechanics which, while not adding a great deal of depth or strategic considerations, make for more exciting skirmishes. Keyblades now come in a number of flavours to match the Disney worlds they're unlocked from. As part of this, they also have Formchanges, which are exactly what they sound like. As you land attack buttons, a meter builds up, and you are eventually given the option to transform your Keyblade into more over-the-top forms, where more powerful attacks and abilities become available. The game shows creative flare in these transformations too; Wheel of Fate, unlocked in the Pirates world, becomes an oversized spear and then the mast of a ship with the flag attached. Happy Gear, found in Monsters Inc., transforms into a set of high-speed claws and then a pair of yo-yos. Hunny Spout morphs into a pair of twin pistols and then a launcher, both firing honey at enemies.

&gt; Magic works similarly, with repeated use of a spell eventually making a Grand Magic version available at no additional mana cost. Throughout, Donald and Goofy will call to Sora for a team-up attack. For the former this could be a salvo of colorful fireworks that damage everyone in your vicinity. For the latter you can leap into the sky and throw Goofy at an enemy, with his shield causing an explosion on impact. These are characters that have fought many battles side by side, so having these back and forths are a nice representation of the camaraderie between them and their growth across the series--not to mention they're eye-catching cinematic moments.

&gt; Feeding into the Disney milieu further are attractions such as tea cups, water rafts, bumper cars, and a rollercoaster that can be summoned to dish out damage. Each one controls differently, either through timed button presses, using the analogue stick to guide their path, or becoming a first-person shooter to pinpoint specific enemies, injecting a different style of combat gameplay into the action at regular intervals. Other Disney characters such as Simba, Stitch, and Ariel can also be called into battle, functioning similarly to Final Fantasy's summons to unleash devastating special attacks.

Except that exclusives also drive consumers to a platform, to a degree. If Sony can convince you to buy a PS4 for The Last of Us 2, that also means they're getting a slice of every third party title you buy for that PS4: Every copy of Madden, Assassin's Creed, COD, Battlefield, etc.

&gt;If a game is built one of the handful of established game engines, it's trivial to port.

Not necessarily. Look at the mess that Arkham Knight was, and that was developed in UE3.

&gt;The difference is so small that it's negligible. This may have been true of pre-7th Generation consoles, but now a days dollar for dollar, performance is the same. It seems like you're idea of console and PC gaming is stuck in the 2000s.

Except that even a lean installation of Windows is going to have more bloat than a console's OS, not including whatever third-party bloat the user has installed on their machine.

the major fucky problems of the game being practically unplayable should have been addressed far earlier than a public preorder demo going out.

there is no excuse for these games of this level of budget to constantly release as broken as they are, and this seems like it might follow the same trend of fallout 76 and battlefield v in this regard.

4853,127,AlternateTimeline_,"Battlefield 4 released on PS4 with a weird rubber banding effect that most agreed was caused by a lack of server resources. Every 3 or 4 seconds you would jerk backwards. Bullets fired vanished, you would suddenly die without being shot, vehicles would bounce around and be impossible to use properly, helicopters were impossible to fly, it was a total mess. The game was basically unplayable for almost an entire year with some maps suffering more than others.

Then, they announced the ""rent a server"" program where players would pay for servers instead of EA and literally the moment that the program went live the rubber banding vanished.

So EA spent an entire year refusing to pay for adequate servers for their biggest game during the launch year of the PS4 and only when the players began to pay for the servers did they open it up and give us servers that worked. 

During this whole time they kept posting ""gee we don't know, it's super weird guys, we're totally investigating, we'll get back to you!"" when the entire time they knew *exactly* what the problem was and refused to solve it.

So EA coming out here and saying that this was unexpected, that they don't know what's causing it or that they couldn't see this problem before a large population played? Yea.. bullshit. They don't like to pay for servers, it's as simple as that. They want to sell a product and then not deliver what you paid for.

Did you even read the article you yourself posted? PC digital sales were not counted, not digital sales as a whole. As it stands the game is behind several console exclusive releases where digital sales are counted on both ends, with physical sales added on PC as a bonus. On top of that it's a mere two spots ahead of Call of Duty: WWII which also didn't have its PC digital sales counted and behind FIFA (also had no digital PC sales counted) which has a consistently weak showing in the US compared to other regions. It's also not in the top 10 games worldwide by [revenue](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/64534/top-10-premium-games-2018-revenue/index.html), further indicating a poor reception. And lastly, Battlefield 1 was on second place in its release year despite also not counting digital PC sales, so unless the market drastically changed since then we have a fairly solid benchmark here to showcase what a game that actually sells really well with those restrictions should look like.

Ultimately, there is no real evidence to indicate that digital sales on PC are somehow enough to make a convincing argument that the game didn't sell poorly. It's one platform that isn't particularly huge in the US, it seems very unlikely that it made that much of a difference, especially when other games that are known to have sold well have shown themselves to be competitive in the rankings while also not counting these sales.",1548239840,9,1548236240.0,Battlefield,0.0004640854

Have you played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and thought, ""How about instead of a ship on the seven seas, it's a ship in space!"" for space combat? If so, then this is the game for you! No 3D fighting design, just target and fire! In all seriousness, despite how weird that sounds, it actually works for the game. You to select your type of ship, broadside weapons, turrets, etc. and retrofit your ship the way you want it. The story is okay but the large worlds you travel around are great! There is no landing/planet-side action, just all space ship combat. Sometimes you get a distress signal that's a trap and you have to fight your way out of it. Other times you get pulled out of hyperspace by a giant ship and when the AI says ""Threat Level: RED"", you move your ass out of there as fast as possible.

Overall, the game is great. The AI/enemies can get a little cheezy at times - fights that you should win get you obliterated while other times you take on enemies like a pro. Another bonus is the music - it's all old-time twangy rock songs; very reminiscent of Firefly but a little down 'n dirtier. If you're looking for something different, watch some youtube videos to get an idea of it and give it a shot!

\*\*Star Wars - Battlefront 2 (2018)\*\*

Ok...so...

Let's get one thing clear here...I really want to love DICE Battlefield games. I mean, I do, I really do. I've played every Battlefield since Battlefield 2142 (where I fell in love with the series). They can be some really fun, beautiful games, stuffed with amazing settings and battle moments. Battlefront 2 is no exception...it is a gorgeous game that really shows off the visuals of Star Wars never really shown in a video game. The settings look movie-quality, the effects are amazing, and the music is stellar. That being said there's still an unmistakable issue here that follows DICE games like a voodoo curse...

Matchmaking/Team-Balancing.

 I can't tell you how many times I've been apart of a group where we were 4 players down, only to have an incoming player go to the other time, because you know, they were missing one more player and \*that's\* not very fair of their almost-full-team so send him over! Then people on your team quit because why stick around to get slaughtered with what precious free time you have in life? I have full-time job, an infant, etc - my free time is valuable. Why go through that?

You know what's really fun about DICE games? Knowing whether you won or lost the round barely five. minutes. in. No joke, this is something Battlefield/Battlefront players know all too well. I mean, how do game designers like DICE do that? It's like you actually have to TRY to get teams to be that lop-sided for these astronomically awful rounds. It's mind-boggling how far we are in these franchises and DICE still CANNOT get team-balancing and matchmaking right.

So Battlefront 2, like all DICE games, is an amazing game...when everything lines up just right. When it doesn't, even when it's just a little bit off, you'll find yourself rage-quitting and playing another game that actually WANTS you to be competitive with each other, instead of creating farming teams to get as much XP as possible in a round or whatever sociopathic medals/challenges they invent for you to get a gun skin because why have the player just buy it when he can kill 20 people in a round with a 3-bullet pistol to get a stupid different color?

So yeah, I'll give the game a 7 out of 10, but it's sliding to a 6. The unlocking system is actually okay. Getting destroyed 3 rounds in a row because you ended up on the ""wrong"" team...not so much.",1548121520,7,1548117920.0,Battlefield,0.9561968

4883,157,Iosis,"I do want to note that I'm not at all going to encourage anyone to preorder this. Even outside of the usual ""never preorder games"" thing (a rule I break all the time myself), this *is* still Bioware/EA we're talking about, and even when Bioware's at their best, it's like a 50/50 shot whether this game is going to be ""pretty good"" or ""absolutely awful.""

&gt;So the first one, and one of the most important for me, is the build choices.

Well, to start with, I'll note that I was comparing it to Destiny 2, where you're pretty locked down when it comes to build choices. As you noticed, when you pick a subclass, you then really just pick one cluster of pre-chosen abilities within that subclass. You don't have a lot of freedom there. Anthem has more freedom than that, but I don't want to suggest it has a huge and deep wealth of options (mostly because I have no idea what the full game will offer). It allows more freedom than Destiny 2, but so did Destiny 1.

As for how it all actually works, the only video I can find is [extremely long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhNaLyycPN0), but to summarize what I remember, it basically comes down to the fact that almost all of your gear in Anthem directly relates to your abilities. Each javelin has four active ability slots and like six or seven options for each slot (many of which haven't been shown off yet), and then the gear you equip modifies those abilities further. It remains to be seen how much those modifications matter and how many viable loadouts there really are, but that definitely seems more fun to play around with than Destiny 2's loadouts, at least for me.

&gt;I'll state crudely that Destiny 2's classes for me were basically: Warrior (Tank) / Rogue(Agile DPS) / Mage(Support). Aren't Anthems classes pretty much just that, too?

That's not all that true in Destiny 2. Ultimately, the classes *look* like they're Warrior, Rogue, and Mage, but in the end they all play fairly similarly. Each one is exactly as good with guns as everyone else (which I actually think it smart in an FPS game--it'd suck to be the class that sucks with guns), and each one can build to be just as durable or mobile as any of the others. They all have subclasses that have strong offensive/DPS abilities and support/crowd control abilities. And ultimately, the times when your class (or rather subclass) really feels unique is when you use your super--and even then, the majority of supers are ""do a lot of damage to one enemy or a bunch of enemies,"" with only a couple of exceptions for each class.

To put it another way, there really isn't a tank class in Destiny 2. The Warlock does have the strongest support super as of Forsaken and the only real support-focused subclass build (the Dawnblade's ""Attunement of Grace"" build), but that's the closest anyone comes to really being a support class.

The things that make Anthem look like it has better niches for classes to me are:

* The combo system. This is something Bioware has used in all of their games since Mass Effect 2, actually. Classes have a certain range of effects they can use to set up combos and effects they can use to ""detonate"" those combos. Because no class or build can really cover all of the options, that helps encourage teamwork between classes, which I like.
* Anthem's classes all *move* differently, and in more ways than just jumping (which is how Destiny 2's classes feel most different). There's no class in Destiny 2 that's like Anthem's Colossus, for example, where you're this huge, hulking metal suit that just has a ton of health and no shields. That's wildly different from the Storm, who has a tiny health pool but a lot of shields and can fly above the battlefield almost indefinitely. That degree of difference doesn't happen in Destiny.
* This part actually concerns me a little, but each javelin also seems to have a different focus when it comes to what kind of guns they use. I don't know for sure--it's been a while since I've checked in on what kind of gear each javelin can use--but it does seem like there are weapon types that, say, only the Colossus can use, or only the Interceptor. If that's balanced well, it's a good way to differentiate them; if it's balanced poorly, it's going to be very frustrating (which is why Destiny 2 doesn't have any weapon restrictions on classes at all).

I'll note that part of the reason Anthem's javelins can be so different from one another is that Anthem has no PvP at all. Destiny 2 has to be balanced for PvP, so they can't give players abilities that would suck to have used against you, and they can't design a class around a core concept that would be awful in PvP (like the Storm's focus on hovering over the battlefield would just make them a huge, glowing target in PvP). When the game is PvE-only, there's a lot more freedom to allow things to kinda go nuts in terms of what players are allowed to do.",1548169756,6,1548166156.0,Battlefield,0.015285003

* Interceptor: similar to the Ranger (maybe too similar). Focused on speed. You do feel VERY agile in this one. Its melee strike is really powerful and you can execute it successively pretty quickly. If you've played a Hunter in Destiny, it's kind of like that.
* Colossus: I think there's a huge skill ceiling with this Javelin. Higher risk but higher reward. It's not nearly as agile as the others, and its shield is OFF by default. You have to hit your ""dodge"" button to pull it out. Your melee abilities are powerful but slow. The (default?) Ultimate ability feels REALLY powerful. I feel like this will be the hardest Javelin to be proficient with.
* Storm: I suspect this will be the most popular Javelin. It's pretty awesome to be able to hover above the battlefield and rain down elemental attacks. I felt by far the most powerful in this Javelin. I slotted two shield boosts and never really felt in danger, meanwhile my offensive power was just insane.

4888,162,King_Kroket,"&gt; forces you to be more selective about where you go 

I'd argue it forces people to 'hold their ground' a lot more. I'm not if that's what you mean here as well. I simultaneously notice that close quarters fights turn into a more cod esque sprayfest. While long range fights are often just prone battles and ""who moves first loses"".  

It's also highly encouraged people to ""stick together"" which has only amplified a increasingly more common problem in bf games of spawning these giant ""zerg balls"" where you have 80% of a team running around together capping flag after flag. While the other 20% is back-capping doing most of the work.

That being said, I've never played 76, but the bugs that were RE introduced just fucking break it.

I mean, use a game like Borderlands 2 as an example where duping was pretty much a feature and helped people get through the grind of killing Raid Bosses, you know, NPCs, and compare that instead to using those same broken ass guns and equipment IN MULTIPLAYER.

Yeah. BF4 was unstable, buggy, ugly, and then they ported it over to the goddamn next gen games instead of waiting, like, a month?

I mean, not only did they wait, they didn't fix ANY of the issues from launch a whole month later.

Now, Bethesda DID fix the glitches and bugs, BUT REINTRODUCED THEM.

Okay I'm siding with F76 being the worst fucking launch ever now.

Dice and EA did fix BF4, and now that it's stable I can fondly look back on that game and say that it was very good after launch. Of course it took about 6 months from what I remember to fix absolutely everything, but the game was damn excellent after the patch.

If Bethesda fixes the game now, and I mean EVERYTHING, you still have a game that a lot of people enjoy despite it's downfalls. Mainly speaking, the lack of NPCs and story from what I've heard.

It wouldn't be a bad game at all.

But all of Bethesdas incompetence leads me to believe that 6 months would be the minimum amount of time. That it'll get hot patched but mainly remain a broken, duct taped together, dripping mess for a good 8-12 months post launch at best until Bethesda actually manages to fix this shit.

Not even close. There is almost zero element of team-play in the modern Battlefronts. In the older games, you had medic, engineer, and pilot classes that were unique and provide different dynamics to gameplay. They were literally Battlefield clones in the best way possible, while the modern games try too hard to break the Battlefield mold.

&gt;All are better than the original games.

Very subjective. Selection of vehicles and how they operate on the battlefield was undeniably better in the old games, however, as was the selection and variety of maps.

&gt;I don't even comprehend what you could possibly mean by this.

That it is a shallow, bland game with very little depth. It was originally designed to entice players to sink inordinate amounts of time into the game, or pay for shitty business practices.

4896,170,MrTastix,"The problem is peanut butter generally tastes the same all round so the differences between cheap vs expensive are few, not to mention they're sold at the same stores in the same aisle.

Two first-person shooters are not often alike, though. Battlefield and Call of Duty are both war-themed multiplayer team-based deathmatch shooters but they share differences in art direction, level design, and character customization that sets them apart.

With regards to Metro: Exodus there's few games that share the setting it does and none that are based on the novels by Dmitry Glukhovsky, so you either play that game or you play nothing.

At least with if my supermarket only sells Kraft peanut butter I still get fucking peanut butter.

As a side-note: Good peanut butter consists of two ingredients: 99% peanuts, 1% salt. You shouldn't need vegetable oil or sugar, though many popular brands (including Kraft, Jif, and Skippy) add these.

Picked it up for $5 on PC. Have to say I'm having more fun with this, than, say, Battlefield. And I have played almost every BF game except for 5 (yet). I do prefer the more casual approach.

It is not without its issues though. 

Underleveled players will get curb-stomped by those with better star cards and weapons w/mods. I would honestly prefer if everything is already unlocked and given a single level, since some firefights bordered on ""Oh, he had higher health and faster recharge than my guy."" [As Raycevick puts it best, imagine if in Overwatch, McCree grinders get a star card that makes his revolver stronger.](https://youtu.be/Y1C7Hc6rZSs?t=398)

Some gamemodes are also wildly outbalanced, such as Heroes vs Villains where it's a VIP hunt. Most of the time, Boba Fett players just run away, which is annoying. For Starfighter Assault, you better buy a controller for it.

I also just finished the campaign today.

Do you think when the game's trailer was first revealed, the writers were sweating bullets when they saw so many ""I hope the protagonist doesn't do the predictable thing"" comments?

But besides that, what hurt more about the story is that the plot doesn't take time to breath with its character development. Luke Skywalker and Del's stage fits well, but most other stages felt like filler until Jakku. Understandably, the writers were severely limited as LucasFilm didn't want to reveal the First Order's background yet, but man, it did hurt the story.

Probably the most significant is **Titanfall**. EA has these full game timed trials. Titanfall was 48 hours. Battlefield 4 was a week. I had stopped playing online shooters after the Quake craze kind of died down and shooters moved over to, like, Modern Warfare. Before that I was hugely into to online arena shooters. The modern games just felt so sluggish, slow, and unbalanced. Pretty skeptical of Titanfall. Only reason I think I wound up trying it was because the trial was free.

4903,177,PlatinumWalrus,"&gt; There are numerous layers on top of the basic combat mechanics which, while not adding a great deal of depth or strategic considerations, make for more exciting skirmishes. Keyblades now come in a number of flavours to match the Disney worlds they're unlocked from. As part of this, they also have Formchanges, which are exactly what they sound like. As you land attack buttons, a meter builds up, and you are eventually given the option to transform your Keyblade into more over-the-top forms, where more powerful attacks and abilities become available. The game shows creative flare in these transformations too; Wheel of Fate, unlocked in the Pirates world, becomes an oversized spear and then the mast of a ship with the flag attached. Happy Gear, found in Monsters Inc., transforms into a set of high-speed claws and then a pair of yo-yos. Hunny Spout morphs into a pair of twin pistols and then a launcher, both firing honey at enemies.

&gt; Magic works similarly, with repeated use of a spell eventually making a Grand Magic version available at no additional mana cost. Throughout, Donald and Goofy will call to Sora for a team-up attack. For the former this could be a salvo of colorful fireworks that damage everyone in your vicinity. For the latter you can leap into the sky and throw Goofy at an enemy, with his shield causing an explosion on impact. These are characters that have fought many battles side by side, so having these back and forths are a nice representation of the camaraderie between them and their growth across the series--not to mention they're eye-catching cinematic moments.

&gt; Feeding into the Disney milieu further are attractions such as tea cups, water rafts, bumper cars, and a rollercoaster that can be summoned to dish out damage. Each one controls differently, either through timed button presses, using the analogue stick to guide their path, or becoming a first-person shooter to pinpoint specific enemies, injecting a different style of combat gameplay into the action at regular intervals. Other Disney characters such as Simba, Stitch, and Ariel can also be called into battle, functioning similarly to Final Fantasy's summons to unleash devastating special attacks. Their inclusion is welcome, in lieu of giving them their own worlds, as some have had in past games. Beyond that there's Flowmotion, which builds a sense of speed by encouraging you to dash into objects in the environment to swing around, or at walls to parkour along. It can be tricky to get a handle of, but once you're able to work these moves into the flow of combat, you build a sense of prowess over the battlefield.

Except that exclusives also drive consumers to a platform, to a degree. If Sony can convince you to buy a PS4 for The Last of Us 2, that also means they're getting a slice of every third party title you buy for that PS4: Every copy of Madden, Assassin's Creed, COD, Battlefield, etc.

&gt;If a game is built one of the handful of established game engines, it's trivial to port.

Not necessarily. Look at the mess that Arkham Knight was, and that was developed in UE3.

&gt;The difference is so small that it's negligible. This may have been true of pre-7th Generation consoles, but now a days dollar for dollar, performance is the same. It seems like you're idea of console and PC gaming is stuck in the 2000s.

Except that even a lean installation of Windows is going to have more bloat than a console's OS, not including whatever third-party bloat the user has installed on their machine.

4949,223,AlternateTimeline_,"Battlefield 4 released on PS4 with a weird rubber banding effect that most agreed was caused by a lack of server resources. Every 3 or 4 seconds you would jerk backwards. Bullets fired vanished, you would suddenly die without being shot, vehicles would bounce around and be impossible to use properly, helicopters were impossible to fly, it was a total mess. The game was basically unplayable for almost an entire year with some maps suffering more than others.

Then, they announced the ""rent a server"" program where players would pay for servers instead of EA and literally the moment that the program went live the rubber banding vanished.

So EA spent an entire year refusing to pay for adequate servers for their biggest game during the launch year of the PS4 and only when the players began to pay for the servers did they open it up and give us servers that worked. 

During this whole time they kept posting ""gee we don't know, it's super weird guys, we're totally investigating, we'll get back to you!"" when the entire time they knew *exactly* what the problem was and refused to solve it.

So EA coming out here and saying that this was unexpected, that they don't know what's causing it or that they couldn't see this problem before a large population played? Yea.. bullshit. They don't like to pay for servers, it's as simple as that. They want to sell a product and then not deliver what you paid for. 

And I'll also add here for anyone that read this far, stay the fuck away from this game until it proves itself. EA have already admitted that the ""economy"" has been changed for the demo.

It always seemed weird what kind of relationship those two companies really had, and reading about it being basically the opposite (Overkill in control of Starbreeze) of what you would've expecteded based off the assumption that Overkill was the developing company and Starbreeze controlled everything, gave Overkill at least several opportunities to use Starbreeze as a punching bag and turn a bad situation into somewhat of a PR success.",1548684221,11,1548680621.0,Battlefield,0.36639872

Did you even read the article you yourself posted? PC digital sales were not counted, not digital sales as a whole. As it stands the game is behind several console exclusive releases where digital sales are counted on both ends, with physical sales added on PC as a bonus. On top of that it's a mere two spots ahead of Call of Duty: WWII which also didn't have its PC digital sales counted and behind FIFA (also had no digital PC sales counted) which has a consistently weak showing in the US compared to other regions. It's also not in the top 10 games worldwide by [revenue](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/64534/top-10-premium-games-2018-revenue/index.html), further indicating a poor reception. And lastly, Battlefield 1 was on second place in its release year despite also not counting digital PC sales, so unless the market drastically changed since then we have a fairly solid benchmark here to showcase what a game that actually sells really well with those restrictions should look like.

Ultimately, there is no real evidence to indicate that digital sales on PC are somehow enough to make a convincing argument that the game didn't sell poorly.

Have you played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and thought, ""How about instead of a ship on the seven seas, it's a ship in space!"" for space combat? If so, then this is the game for you! No 3D fighting design, just target and fire! In all seriousness, despite how weird that sounds, it actually works for the game. You to select your type of ship, broadside weapons, turrets, etc. and retrofit your ship the way you want it. The story is okay but the large worlds you travel around are great! There is no landing/planet-side action, just all space ship combat. Sometimes you get a distress signal that's a trap and you have to fight your way out of it. Other times you get pulled out of hyperspace by a giant ship and when the AI says ""Threat Level: RED"", you move your ass out of there as fast as possible.

Overall, the game is great. The AI/enemies can get a little cheezy at times - fights that you should win get you obliterated while other times you take on enemies like a pro. Another bonus is the music - it's all old-time twangy rock songs; very reminiscent of Firefly but a little down 'n dirtier. If you're looking for something different, watch some youtube videos to get an idea of it and give it a shot!

\*\*Star Wars - Battlefront 2 (2018)\*\*

Ok...so...

Let's get one thing clear here...I really want to love DICE Battlefield games. I mean, I do, I really do. I've played every Battlefield since Battlefield 2142 (where I fell in love with the series). They can be some really fun, beautiful games, stuffed with amazing settings and battle moments. Battlefront 2 is no exception...it is a gorgeous game that really shows off the visuals of Star Wars never really shown in a video game. The settings look movie-quality, the effects are amazing, and the music is stellar. That being said there's still an unmistakable issue here that follows DICE games like a voodoo curse...

Matchmaking/Team-Balancing.

 I can't tell you how many times I've been apart of a group where we were 4 players down, only to have an incoming player go to the other time, because you know, they were missing one more player and \*that's\* not very fair of their almost-full-team so send him over! Then people on your team quit because why stick around to get slaughtered with what precious free time you have in life? I have full-time job, an infant, etc - my free time is valuable. Why go through that?

You know what's really fun about DICE games? Knowing whether you won or lost the round barely five. minutes. in. No joke, this is something Battlefield/Battlefront players know all too well. I mean, how do game designers like DICE do that? It's like you actually have to TRY to get teams to be that lop-sided for these astronomically awful rounds. It's mind-boggling how far we are in these franchises and DICE still CANNOT get team-balancing and matchmaking right.

So Battlefront 2, like all DICE games, is an amazing game...when everything lines up just right. When it doesn't, even when it's just a little bit off, you'll find yourself rage-quitting and playing another game that actually WANTS you to be competitive with each other, instead of creating farming teams to get as much XP as possible in a round or whatever sociopathic medals/challenges they invent for you to get a gun skin because why have the player just buy it when he can kill 20 people in a round with a 3-bullet pistol to get a stupid different color?

So yeah, I'll give the game a 7 out of 10, but it's sliding to a 6. The unlocking system is actually okay. Getting destroyed 3 rounds in a row because you ended up on the ""wrong"" team...not so much.",1548121520,7,1548117920.0,Battlefield,0.9561968

Even outside of the usual ""never preorder games"" thing (a rule I break all the time myself), this *is* still Bioware/EA we're talking about, and even when Bioware's at their best, it's like a 50/50 shot whether this game is going to be ""pretty good"" or ""absolutely awful.""

&gt;So the first one, and one of the most important for me, is the build choices.

Well, to start with, I'll note that I was comparing it to Destiny 2, where you're pretty locked down when it comes to build choices. As you noticed, when you pick a subclass, you then really just pick one cluster of pre-chosen abilities within that subclass. You don't have a lot of freedom there. Anthem has more freedom than that, but I don't want to suggest it has a huge and deep wealth of options (mostly because I have no idea what the full game will offer). It allows more freedom than Destiny 2, but so did Destiny 1.

As for how it all actually works, the only video I can find is [extremely long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhNaLyycPN0), but to summarize what I remember, it basically comes down to the fact that almost all of your gear in Anthem directly relates to your abilities. Each javelin has four active ability slots and like six or seven options for each slot (many of which haven't been shown off yet), and then the gear you equip modifies those abilities further. It remains to be seen how much those modifications matter and how many viable loadouts there really are, but that definitely seems more fun to play around with than Destiny 2's loadouts, at least for me.

&gt;I'll state crudely that Destiny 2's classes for me were basically: Warrior (Tank) / Rogue(Agile DPS) / Mage(Support). Aren't Anthems classes pretty much just that, too?

That's not all that true in Destiny 2. Ultimately, the classes *look* like they're Warrior, Rogue, and Mage, but in the end they all play fairly similarly. Each one is exactly as good with guns as everyone else (which I actually think it smart in an FPS game--it'd suck to be the class that sucks with guns), and each one can build to be just as durable or mobile as any of the others. They all have subclasses that have strong offensive/DPS abilities and support/crowd control abilities. And ultimately, the times when your class (or rather subclass) really feels unique is when you use your super--and even then, the majority of supers are ""do a lot of damage to one enemy or a bunch of enemies,"" with only a couple of exceptions for each class.

To put it another way, there really isn't a tank class in Destiny 2. The Warlock does have the strongest support super as of Forsaken and the only real support-focused subclass build (the Dawnblade's ""Attunement of Grace"" build), but that's the closest anyone comes to really being a support class.

The things that make Anthem look like it has better niches for classes to me are:

* The combo system. This is something Bioware has used in all of their games since Mass Effect 2, actually. Classes have a certain range of effects they can use to set up combos and effects they can use to ""detonate"" those combos. Because no class or build can really cover all of the options, that helps encourage teamwork between classes, which I like.
* Anthem's classes all *move* differently, and in more ways than just jumping (which is how Destiny 2's classes feel most different). There's no class in Destiny 2 that's like Anthem's Colossus, for example, where you're this huge, hulking metal suit that just has a ton of health and no shields. That's wildly different from the Storm, who has a tiny health pool but a lot of shields and can fly above the battlefield almost indefinitely. That degree of difference doesn't happen in Destiny.
* This part actually concerns me a little, but each javelin also seems to have a different focus when it comes to what kind of guns they use. I don't know for sure--it's been a while since I've checked in on what kind of gear each javelin can use--but it does seem like there are weapon types that, say, only the Colossus can use, or only the Interceptor. If that's balanced well, it's a good way to differentiate them; if it's balanced poorly, it's going to be very frustrating (which is why Destiny 2 doesn't have any weapon restrictions on classes at all).

I'll note that part of the reason Anthem's javelins can be so different from one another is that Anthem has no PvP at all. Destiny 2 has to be balanced for PvP, so they can't give players abilities that would suck to have used against you, and they can't design a class around a core concept that would be awful in PvP (like the Storm's focus on hovering over the battlefield would just make them a huge, glowing target in PvP). When the game is PvE-only, there's a lot more freedom to allow things to kinda go nuts in terms of what players are allowed to do.",1548169756,6,1548166156.0,Battlefield,0.015285003

* Interceptor: similar to the Ranger (maybe too similar). Focused on speed. You do feel VERY agile in this one. Its melee strike is really powerful and you can execute it successively pretty quickly. If you've played a Hunter in Destiny, it's kind of like that.
* Colossus: I think there's a huge skill ceiling with this Javelin. Higher risk but higher reward. It's not nearly as agile as the others, and its shield is OFF by default. You have to hit your ""dodge"" button to pull it out. Your melee abilities are powerful but slow. The (default?) Ultimate ability feels REALLY powerful. I feel like this will be the hardest Javelin to be proficient with.
* Storm: I suspect this will be the most popular Javelin. It's pretty awesome to be able to hover above the battlefield and rain down elemental attacks. I felt by far the most powerful in this Javelin. I slotted two shield boosts and never really felt in danger, meanwhile my offensive power was just insane.

Very subjective. Selection of vehicles and how they operate on the battlefield was undeniably better in the old games, however, as was the selection and variety of maps.

That it is a shallow, bland game with very little depth. It was originally designed to entice players to sink inordinate amounts of time into the game, or pay for shitty business practices.

With regards to Metro: Exodus there's few games that share the setting it does and none that are based on the novels by Dmitry Glukhovsky, so you either play that game or you play nothing.

At least with if my supermarket only sells Kraft peanut butter I still get fucking peanut butter.

Picked it up for $5 on PC. Have to say I'm having more fun with this, than, say, Battlefield. And I have played almost every BF game except for 5 (yet). I do prefer the more casual approach.

It is not without its issues though. 

Underleveled players will get curb-stomped by those with better star cards and weapons w/mods. I would honestly prefer if everything is already unlocked and given a single level, since some firefights bordered on ""Oh, he had higher health and faster recharge than my guy."" [As Raycevick puts it best, imagine if in Overwatch, McCree grinders get a star card that makes his revolver stronger.](https://youtu.be/Y1C7Hc6rZSs?t=398)

Some gamemodes are also wildly outbalanced, such as Heroes vs Villains where it's a VIP hunt. Most of the time, Boba Fett players just run away, which is annoying. For Starfighter Assault, you better buy a controller for it.

I also just finished the campaign today.

Do you think when the game's trailer was first revealed, the writers were sweating bullets when they saw so many ""I hope the protagonist doesn't do the predictable thing"" comments?

But besides that, what hurt more about the story is that the plot doesn't take time to breath with its character development. Luke Skywalker and Del's stage fits well, but most other stages felt like filler until Jakku. Understandably, the writers were severely limited as LucasFilm didn't want to reveal the First Order's background yet, but man, it did hurt the story.

4992,266,PlatinumWalrus,"&gt; There are numerous layers on top of the basic combat mechanics which, while not adding a great deal of depth or strategic considerations, make for more exciting skirmishes. Keyblades now come in a number of flavours to match the Disney worlds they're unlocked from. As part of this, they also have Formchanges, which are exactly what they sound like. As you land attack buttons, a meter builds up, and you are eventually given the option to transform your Keyblade into more over-the-top forms, where more powerful attacks and abilities become available. The game shows creative flare in these transformations too; Wheel of Fate, unlocked in the Pirates world, becomes an oversized spear and then the mast of a ship with the flag attached. Happy Gear, found in Monsters Inc., transforms into a set of high-speed claws and then a pair of yo-yos. Hunny Spout morphs into a pair of twin pistols and then a launcher, both firing honey at enemies.

&gt; Magic works similarly, with repeated use of a spell eventually making a Grand Magic version available at no additional mana cost. Throughout, Donald and Goofy will call to Sora for a team-up attack. For the former this could be a salvo of colorful fireworks that damage everyone in your vicinity. For the latter you can leap into the sky and throw Goofy at an enemy, with his shield causing an explosion on impact. These are characters that have fought many battles side by side, so having these back and forths are a nice representation of the camaraderie between them and their growth across the series--not to mention they're eye-catching cinematic moments.

&gt; Feeding into the Disney milieu further are attractions such as tea cups, water rafts, bumper cars, and a rollercoaster that can be summoned to dish out damage. Each one controls differently, either through timed button presses, using the analogue stick to guide their path, or becoming a first-person shooter to pinpoint specific enemies, injecting a different style of combat gameplay into the action at regular intervals. Other Disney characters such as Simba, Stitch, and Ariel can also be called into battle, functioning similarly to Final Fantasy's summons to unleash devastating special attacks. Their inclusion is welcome, in lieu of giving them their own worlds, as some have had in past games. Beyond that there's Flowmotion, which builds a sense of speed by encouraging you to dash into objects in the environment to swing around, or at walls to parkour along. It can be tricky to get a handle of, but once you're able to work these moves into the flow of combat, you build a sense of prowess over the battlefield.

Not necessarily. Look at the mess that Arkham Knight was, and that was developed in UE3.

5016,290,falconbox,"&gt;indie games sell better on Switch than anywhere else. It's a FACT. 

Because there's less competition from various AAA multiplatform games?

On Switch you've got the big Nintendo published games, and often nothing else in between those releases (maybe a port of an old game occasionally).  So if you're not interested in Mario Party or something, you could be waiting months for a big new game.

Indies fill that void.

On PS4 and Xbox, you've got stuff like RDR2, AC Odyssey, Metro Exodus, Sekiro, Battlefield, etc that fill the gaps between exclusives.

The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

I can't think of a single Star Wars EA game that did for me what KotOR, Rogue Squadron, Jedi Knights, Jedi Academy the original Battle Fronts and even that Pod Racing game did for me in my youth. Could be my age, but all the EA games were pretty vanilla and disappointing when I tried them. 

Bonus: Even though it was bad, I also really liked that Jedi Power Battles game because you could make a light saber longer than the screen with a game shark, and that was fun. ",1548296229,22,1548292629.0,Battlefront,0.9992926

5065,11,Hallitsijan,"&gt; But others pointed out that the Belgium Gaming Commission's definition specifically requires there to be ""a game element"" in opening the crate, which differentiates loot boxes from trading cards.

Not entirely true. The Gaming Commission did mention the game elements as an aggravating element in their earlier statements, yes, but the game elements are not part of the law.

What is part of the law is an exclusion of physical card games from the gambling law. Because what people don't realise is that this isn't a new law at all. Our gambling law dates back to the 90s. It was late updated in the early 2010s to deal with online poker casinos. It was never updated to specifically deal with videogames and microtransactions. 

That's because the Gaming Commission DOES NOT pass laws. Parliament passes laws. Commission only interprets and enforces those laws. When people started lobbying against Battlefront, the Commission just woke up and decided to finally investigate microtransactions in videogames. NONE OF THIS required a change of the law.

Anyway, the reason pokemon cards (and other card games) are not part of the law ... I mentioned this law was written in the 90s. Cartamundi is one of the biggest card printers in the world and is a Belgian company. They were smart enough to realise in the 90s what impact this law could have and lobbied already at that time to get certain kinds of card games excluded.

Not to say you can do anything you want here as long as it involves cards, there's still limits; like poker tournaments for hard cash ARE labeled as gambling as well.

5067,13,tekspert," See the problems with Star Wars games now are several ones. The first one is that EA, Disney and Lucas Arts are all big names - BioWare was not that big when they created KOTOR and they did not have to fill the high expectations for profits like Battlefront has to. Pandemic also did not have to fill that many checks when they created the first Battlefront. There are so many major players behind Star Wars right now that is impossible that the fans will likely get what they want. There is also the different times we live in - then a game had to be good for it to be sold, the publishers nowadays understand that this is not longer true. For better or worse the mobile gaming showed companies that you do not need some fancy game to turn profit. Also you do not need to give the content you have created to the players. DLC, loot boxes and etc. - maybe because in the past the companies believed that to convince you to pay for their game the game had to be extra long and consistent the games gave you 90% of the content right off the bat. I think currently the strategy is pay-over-time - you make a game, give it to the masses and then slowly but surely get your money through DLC's, extra packs, skins and etc. Now the companies have access to statistics and data through various social media channels and they are much more confident in their decisions. They can see how the industry move and how the competitors are performing on all fronts. They do not make foolish move even if they loose some short-term customer satisfaction. Last but not least the player base is not particularly consistent - especially the general mass of people who can outrage today and tomorrow they will be still playing Battlefront II. AngryJoe and Dunkey will have you believe that the anger is wide-spread and ever-lasting - no, and it will never be. Even if EA gives up the license the next publisher will likely have one game to prove they are not EA but then we will be back to the same mess. Look at Star Wars movies - once Disney took over I think a lot of people believed things will be different. No George Lucas, no problem. Then The Last Jedi and Solo came along and people want Disney to stay away from Star Wars. No EA, no problem amirite fellas!? ",1548673932,17,1548670332.0,Battlefront,0.0041583423

Free Radical co-founder Steve Ellis:
&gt;It was pretty much done, it was in final QA. It had been in final QA for half of 2008 it was just being fixed for release.

After being criticized for saying it was [""99%"" complete, he said this:](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-lucasarts-employee-on-why-star-wars-battlefront-iii-failed/1100-6400936/)
&gt;Objectively though, the game was 'content complete' and we were fixing bugs. ... At the time that the development on BFIII was stopped, the figures showed that we would close our 'must-fix' bugs with 3-4 weeks. So yes, maybe on reflection 99 percent was a little of an exaggeration. I probably should have said 97 percent or 98 percent.""

The leaked footage on youtube also shows development was quite far. We'll never know for sure of course, but it's generally the case that a game is ""content complete"" before it goes into the beta phase, which is mostly bug fixing.

5072,18,Freighnos,"So there's a lot to unpack in what you said. First of all, I agree that community engagement is important to a lot of people, but with so many games coming out in any given month, how can you possibly keep up with all of them? Maybe if you're a teenager with unlimited free time and a lot of disposable income, but for the rest of us we have to choose. You simply cannot be a part of the conversation for every single game. If Metro is a big enough deal to you that you HAVE to play it on day one, then the Epic Games move isn't going to stop you. 

Being a patient gamer isn't about NEVER buying a game at release or ALWAYS waiting a year or whatever, it's about seeing past the marketing hype cycles and the FOMO and choosing how you want to allocate your finite time and money in a way that makes you happiest. It has the added benefits of purchasing games much cheaper, after legions of people have already ""beta tested"" it for bugs, and once the DLC is bundled in so you can get the most complete experience. 

Also, a lot of games get people really hyped for a month or two and then fall completely off the map. If that's the case then maybe it wasn't as hypeworthy as you assumed. People are still talking about Breath of the Wild and Witcher 3 years later, but I haven't seen anyone saying anything about Far Cry 5 for months now. Sometimes being a patient gamer is a good way to screen for the games that really stand the test of time.

But again, nobody is holding a gun to your head with this. If it makes you happy to buy Metro at launch so you can make memes and discover the game along with people, then by all means. That's a totally valid way to play.

But going back to the feeling of missing out, that's something companies actively push with their limited time offers and forced exclusivity in order to push consumers into suspending their rational brains and making spur of the moment hype based decisions. How many of us fell for it with No Man's Sky or Battlefront 2 and wish we'd waited even a few weeks?

Dodging spoilers isn't that hard either. If you see a thread discussing that game, just don't click on it. Avoid places that have frequent untagged spoilers. And if you REALLY care enough about one particular game enough to avoid any spoilers whatsoever, then it sounds like you really want to play it in which case it's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy it. No need to torture yourself.

I personally play 99% single-player games, so the community aspect barely matters to me, but half the point of r/patientgamers is also that we now have a community to discuss older games with after the ephemeral hype train has moved on to something else.",1548814507,11,1548810907.0,Battlefront,0.960696

Have you played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and thought, ""How about instead of a ship on the seven seas, it's a ship in space!"" for space combat? If so, then this is the game for you! No 3D fighting design, just target and fire! In all seriousness, despite how weird that sounds, it actually works for the game. You to select your type of ship, broadside weapons, turrets, etc. and retrofit your ship the way you want it. The story is okay but the large worlds you travel around are great! There is no landing/planet-side action, just all space ship combat. Sometimes you get a distress signal that's a trap and you have to fight your way out of it. Other times you get pulled out of hyperspace by a giant ship and when the AI says ""Threat Level: RED"", you move your ass out of there as fast as possible.

Overall, the game is great. The AI/enemies can get a little cheezy at times - fights that you should win get you obliterated while other times you take on enemies like a pro. Another bonus is the music - it's all old-time twangy rock songs; very reminiscent of Firefly but a little down 'n dirtier.

\*\*Star Wars - Battlefront 2 (2018)\*\*

Ok...so...

Let's get one thing clear here...I really want to love DICE Battlefield games. I mean, I do, I really do. I've played every Battlefield since Battlefield 2142 (where I fell in love with the series). They can be some really fun, beautiful games, stuffed with amazing settings and battle moments. Battlefront 2 is no exception...it is a gorgeous game that really shows off the visuals of Star Wars never really shown in a video game. The settings look movie-quality, the effects are amazing, and the music is stellar. That being said there's still an unmistakable issue here that follows DICE games like a voodoo curse...

Matchmaking/Team-Balancing.

 I can't tell you how many times I've been apart of a group where we were 4 players down, only to have an incoming player go to the other time, because you know, they were missing one more player and \*that's\* not very fair of their almost-full-team so send him over! Then people on your team quit because why stick around to get slaughtered with what precious free time you have in life? I have full-time job, an infant, etc - my free time is valuable. Why go through that?

You know what's really fun about DICE games? Knowing whether you won or lost the round barely five. minutes. in. No joke, this is something Battlefield/Battlefront players know all too well. I mean, how do game designers like DICE do that? It's like you actually have to TRY to get teams to be that lop-sided for these astronomically awful rounds. It's mind-boggling how far we are in these franchises and DICE still CANNOT get team-balancing and matchmaking right.

So Battlefront 2, like all DICE games, is an amazing game...when everything lines up just right. When it doesn't, even when it's just a little bit off, you'll find yourself rage-quitting and playing another game that actually WANTS you to be competitive with each other, instead of creating farming teams to get as much XP as possible in a round or whatever sociopathic medals/challenges they invent for you to get a gun skin because why have the player just buy it when he can kill 20 people in a round with a 3-bullet pistol to get a stupid different color?

So yeah, I'll give the game a 7 out of 10, but it's sliding to a 6. The unlocking system is actually okay. Getting destroyed 3 rounds in a row because you ended up on the ""wrong"" team...not so much.",1548121520,7,1548117920.0,Battlefront,0.9561968

Picked it up for $5 on PC. Have to say I'm having more fun with this, than, say, Battlefield. And I have played almost every BF game except for 5 (yet). I do prefer the more casual approach.

It is not without its issues though. 

Underleveled players will get curb-stomped by those with better star cards and weapons w/mods. I would honestly prefer if everything is already unlocked and given a single level, since some firefights bordered on ""Oh, he had higher health and faster recharge than my guy."" [As Raycevick puts it best, imagine if in Overwatch, McCree grinders get a star card that makes his revolver stronger.](https://youtu.be/Y1C7Hc6rZSs?t=398)

Some gamemodes are also wildly outbalanced, such as Heroes vs Villains where it's a VIP hunt. Most of the time, Boba Fett players just run away, which is annoying. For Starfighter Assault, you better buy a controller for it.

I also just finished the campaign today.

Do you think when the game's trailer was first revealed, the writers were sweating bullets when they saw so many ""I hope the protagonist doesn't do the predictable thing"" comments?

But besides that, what hurt more about the story is that the plot doesn't take time to breath with its character development. Luke Skywalker and Del's stage fits well, but most other stages felt like filler until Jakku. Understandably, the writers were severely limited as LucasFilm didn't want to reveal the First Order's background yet, but man, it did hurt the story.

5107,53,Guccimayne,"&gt; So you say that the purely cosmetic loot boxes in say Overwatch, are unethical solely because they are loot boxes. 

**Yes**, this is gambling and the game should be rated accordingly. This isn't TF2 or something where the item can be directly purchased from the start. In OW or HotS, you want a particular skin, character or spray. You know you have a *chance* of getting it in a certain loot box, possibly at a certain time of year. You have no more control over the process other than to keep buying boxes in hope that you get it. **Gambling**.

&gt;There is no inherent in game advantage or disadvantage whatsoever to any of the cosmetics whatsoever. 

It doesn't have to be Pay2win to be gambling, my friend. Combining both is terrible, see Battlefront 2. But they can be separate. As long as you're paying for a loot crate with unidentifiable contents, cosmetic or not, it's gambling.

&gt;But because they use the loot boxes system, certain skins are considered more valuable because of their artificial rarity.

See DOTA 2. You have skins for sale from the get go that are cheap and some that are way, way more expensive. They aren't priced that way due to artificial rarity since they aren't rare at all. Anyone has access to them if they want. They're priced that way because of: how detailed they are, or if they have extra sparkly animations, or some combination within. I wish they'd switch to this system, but game makers know they can make *more money* via loot boxes since you'll probably end up spending more on failed boxes than if you outright purchased the item. That's not right.

&gt;And if these loot boxes didn't exist, and the teams were priced a la carte, better teams would inevitably be priced higher because it would suit the license holders interests to get more money

So be it! I'm totally OK with them offering certain items for a set price, based on things such as... whether they have extra, shiny, sparkly animations over the default form. Like I said above. 

Look, that same gambling commission[ noticed a shocking increase in children participating in gambling activities, with lootboxes and video games being a major contributor] (https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/survey-data/Young-People-and-Gambling-2018-Report.pdf).

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

EA, obviously, doesn’t care about their customers and every decision they make seems to be a step in the wrong direction. Disney is in it for the money, but they also care about their public image. They considered pulling the Star Wars license from EA after the failed launch of Battlefront 2 because they knew it would be (and was) very bad for the public’s view of them. A reason that they stayed with EA is that they knew the game would start printing cash after the press moved on to other issues.

Take Spider-Man on the PS4 as an example. Disney did good with giving the license to Insomniac, not only is a great game made that consumers love, it prints cash for Disney without getting negative press. However, if the game launch was bad, it was buggy, and filled with microtransactions and got negative press, but printed cash, Disney would still be happy. In the end, Disney and EA are businesses that care more about making money than having happy customers.",1547603046,1,1547599446.0,Battlefront,0.0018388894

EA found that it wasn't A: worth the time to lose money on a platform that gave them a bad revenue split, and B: using valves own software to improve there games when they have better in house software. Yeah sure you don't like there games they have now and for many in the hardcore gaming community, they haven't produced a ton of games for us, but EA has never tried to appeal to the hardcore gamer, they want the more profitable casual gamer who buys FIFA, and Madden every year along with Battlefront, Anthem and whatever else they put out that year. EA proved to companies that Steam wasn't the one stop shop that everyone think it was, and were now seeing companies like epic take advantage of whats lacking on steam and competing against them.

5225,171,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

5227,173,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

5306,252,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

5308,254,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

It is baffling how much EA has underwhelmed with their Star Wars games so far, and I'm really hoping Jedi: Fallen Order from Respawn Entertainment this year is really good. Battlefront 2 has improved with its subsequent updates, but the core multiplayer gameplay just isn't interesting enough to pull me back in and the single-player was the definition of average with good actors who were squandered.

Disney needs to break contract and give the license to a studio that’ll actually do something

The issue with the battlefront games and the mobile games is that they’re money making machines, and in the end, that’s what EA and Disney are here for. EA, obviously, doesn’t care about their customers and every decision they make seems to be a step in the wrong direction. Disney is in it for the money, but they also care about their public image. They considered pulling the Star Wars license from EA after the failed launch of Battlefront 2 because they knew it would be (and was) very bad for the public’s view of them. A reason that they stayed with EA is that they knew the game would start printing cash after the press moved on to other issues.

Take Spider-Man on the PS4 as an example. Disney did good with giving the license to Insomniac, not only is a great game made that consumers love, it prints cash for Disney without getting negative press. However, if the game launch was bad, it was buggy, and filled with microtransactions and got negative press, but printed cash, Disney would still be happy.

Plus, many of your points are true, independent of the Epic store.  For example, waiting a year to play game, no matter where it's released, will result in a game that probably has all it's DLC done and bugs fixed, even if you could buy it on Steam the entire time.  

Really, patient gamers have almost always won out, in many different ways, over day one purchasers.

Granted, there's been quite a lot of bad Star Wars games in the past too, but all of the good games made up for the bad. Feels like they're just too afraid to take the creative risk and produce something that can't be mass marketed anymore. ",1547599956,1,1547596356.0,Battlefront,0.00031366132

5386,332,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. If the Division doesn't sell then Valve doesn't need to do anything sine Ubisoft will come back by themselves.",1547103024,1,1547099424.0,Battlefront,0.057639983

5388,334,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

The exact reason why battlefront 2 was received so poorly. No actual focus on soild gameplay just ""how can we cram more loot boxes into this bitch""

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem.

Take Spider-Man on the PS4 as an example. Disney did good with giving the license to Insomniac, not only is a great game made that consumers love, it prints cash for Disney without getting negative press.

Plus, many of your points are true, independent of the Epic store.  For example, waiting a year to play game, no matter where it's released, will result in a game that probably has all it's DLC done and bugs fixed, even if you could buy it on Steam the entire time.  

Really, patient gamers have almost always won out, in many different ways, over day one purchasers.

The issue with the battlefront games and the mobile games is that they’re money making machines, and in the end, that’s what EA and Disney are here for. EA, obviously, doesn’t care about their customers and every decision they make seems to be a step in the wrong direction. Disney is in it for the money, but they also care about their public image. They considered pulling the Star Wars license from EA after the failed launch of Battlefront 2 because they knew it would be (and was) very bad for the public’s view of them. A reason that they stayed with EA is that they knew the game would start printing cash after the press moved on to other issues.

Take Spider-Man on the PS4 as an example. Disney did good with giving the license to Insomniac, not only is a great game made that consumers love, it prints cash for Disney without getting negative press. However, if the game launch was bad, it was buggy, and filled with microtransactions and got negative press, but printed cash, Disney would still be happy.

The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me.

You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

Disney needs to break contract and give the license to a studio that’ll actually do something

The issue with the battlefront games and the mobile games is that they’re money making machines, and in the end, that’s what EA and Disney are here for. EA, obviously, doesn’t care about their customers and every decision they make seems to be a step in the wrong direction. Disney is in it for the money, but they also care about their public image. They considered pulling the Star Wars license from EA after the failed launch of Battlefront 2 because they knew it would be (and was) very bad for the public’s view of them. A reason that they stayed with EA is that they knew the game would start printing cash after the press moved on to other issues.

Take Spider-Man on the PS4 as an example. Disney did good with giving the license to Insomniac, not only is a great game made that consumers love, it prints cash for Disney without getting negative press. However, if the game launch was bad, it was buggy, and filled with microtransactions and got negative press, but printed cash, Disney would still be happy.

The issue with the battlefront games and the mobile games is that they’re money making machines, and in the end, that’s what EA and Disney are here for. EA, obviously, doesn’t care about their customers and every decision they make seems to be a step in the wrong direction. Disney is in it for the money, but they also care about their public image. They considered pulling the Star Wars license from EA after the failed launch of Battlefront 2 because they knew it would be (and was) very bad for the public’s view of them. A reason that they stayed with EA is that they knew the game would start printing cash after the press moved on to other issues.

Take Spider-Man on the PS4 as an example. Disney did good with giving the license to Insomniac, not only is a great game made that consumers love, it prints cash for Disney without getting negative press. However, if the game launch was bad, it was buggy, and filled with microtransactions and got negative press, but printed cash, Disney would still be happy.

EA proved to companies that Steam wasn't the one stop shop that everyone think it was, and were now seeing companies like epic take advantage of whats lacking on steam and competing against them.

5539,485,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

5541,487,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

But then again I got almost 450h in Destiny 2.

Gatcha games are scummy for the tactics they use. 

That is the point I am making. I'm sure EA has great explainations for FIFA and Battlefront 2's monitization methods as well, but most people agree that they are scummy. Do you think that FIFA and Battlefront 2 and other ""worse"" gatcha methods are A-ok because well people will buy them? Is Facebook immune from criticism because people still ise the service despite it's flaws? 

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

Plus, many of your points are true, independent of the Epic store.  For example, waiting a year to play game, no matter where it's released, will result in a game that probably has all it's DLC done and bugs fixed, even if you could buy it on Steam the entire time.

Granted, there's been quite a lot of bad Star Wars games in the past too, but all of the good games made up for the bad. Feels like they're just too afraid to take the creative risk and produce something that can't be mass marketed anymore. ",1547599956,1,1547596356.0,Battlefront,0.00031366132

5609,555,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. If the Division doesn't sell then Valve doesn't need to do anything sine Ubisoft will come back by themselves.",1547103024,1,1547099424.0,Battlefront,0.057639983

5611,557,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

Plus, many of your points are true, independent of the Epic store.  For example, waiting a year to play game, no matter where it's released, will result in a game that probably has all it's DLC done and bugs fixed, even if you could buy it on Steam the entire time.

5670,616,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

5672,618,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

Gatcha games are scummy for the tactics they use. 

That is the point I am making. I'm sure EA has great explainations for FIFA and Battlefront 2's monitization methods as well, but most people agree that they are scummy. Do you think that FIFA and Battlefront 2 and other ""worse"" gatcha methods are A-ok because well people will buy them? Is Facebook immune from criticism because people still ise the service despite it's flaws? 

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

Plus, many of your points are true, independent of the Epic store.  For example, waiting a year to play game, no matter where it's released, will result in a game that probably has all it's DLC done and bugs fixed, even if you could buy it on Steam the entire time.

5728,674,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. If the Division doesn't sell then Valve doesn't need to do anything sine Ubisoft will come back by themselves.",1547103024,1,1547099424.0,Battlefront,0.057639983

5730,676,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

Gatcha games are scummy for the tactics they use. 

That is the point I am making. I'm sure EA has great explainations for FIFA and Battlefront 2's monitization methods as well, but most people agree that they are scummy.

Is Facebook immune from criticism because people still ise the service despite it's flaws? 

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

5785,731,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. If the Division doesn't sell then Valve doesn't need to do anything sine Ubisoft will come back by themselves.",1547103024,1,1547099424.0,Battlefront,0.057639983

5787,733,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

Gatcha games are scummy for the tactics they use.

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

I mean, even though it didn't sell as well as it could have, I think Battlefront 2 still sold decently, even with the huge backlash on Reddit and elsewhere for it's exploitative loot box system.

Plus, many of your points are true, independent of the Epic store.  For example, waiting a year to play game, no matter where it's released, will result in a game that probably has all it's DLC done and bugs fixed, even if you could buy it on Steam the entire time.  

Really, patient gamers have almost always won out, in many different ways, over day one purchasers.

It seems to me that with their plan, Epic is banking on people not waiting out the year.  It's a mixed bag for me.

5840,786,ASDFkoll,"I don't think EAs Origin example is comparable. The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

So getting back to Ubisoft jumping ship to Epic games. The Division 2 should be the front-runner for that jump? How many people are interested in the Division? At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

5842,788,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

Gatcha games are scummy for the tactics they use. 

That is the point I am making. I'm sure EA has great explainations for FIFA and Battlefront 2's monitization methods as well, but most people agree that they are scummy. Do you think that FIFA and Battlefront 2 and other ""worse"" gatcha methods are A-ok because well people will buy them? Is Facebook immune from criticism because people still ise the service despite it's flaws? 

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy.

Plus, many of your points are true, independent of the Epic store.  For example, waiting a year to play game, no matter where it's released, will result in a game that probably has all it's DLC done and bugs fixed, even if you could buy it on Steam the entire time.

The biggest reason Origin survived was because EA made the jump when they most likely had their strongest line-up in the last decade. Origin had the staying power because of Battlefield. Maybe also FIFA but because I know literally nothing of that community I have no idea if they even play on PC. When Origin came out Battlefield series was riding on the high of Bad Company 2 and BF3 with BF4 being slightly behind BF3 but still good enough to pull in players. I went on Origin because I loved the BF series and I stayed there until the end 2017 because of Titanfall 2. I had no other reason to use Origin which is why I don't even have Origin installed on my current computer. If EA came out with Origin today I wouldn't give a shit because there's no games I'd want to play on that platform, Battlefield has fallen from grace, Battlefront has always been a shitstorm, the next Titanfall ""might"" come in 2020 and Andromeda didn't pull me. Origin would most likely fail if it came out today because it has no games to actually pull people in.

At the end of its life-cycle it was a good game but I'm not really interested in the sequel and considering how little news we've been getting about this game, I doubt others are either. I don't think the Division has the pulling power to migrate the customers to Epic Games. Either Ubisoft if extremely confident in their game or Epic gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

5883,829,MrFlac00,"I think that the type of game you talk about is pretty interesting and I think it is really cool to have that sort of game. However, I do think that in many ways this is impossible to achieve perfectly in single-player games, and that enjoying these sorts of games for this sort of requires enjoying them for the good parts rather then them being pure.

I think in terms of MMO's, I feel like something like EVE achieves this pretty successfully by literally making you part of a part of a pre-existing infrastructure of other players. You can join a corporation and be a small time lacky and can role play it, though it is sort-of cheating because real human interactions never allow everyone to be in the ""protagonist"" role. But like you said, this is harder to find in non-MMO's.

I think there are a few games that can give you that feel from a story standpoint, the problem is that many storylines have the end conclusion that the player goes from a lowly cog to becoming a societal mover. Something like GTA 3 or 4 starts the character as being a schmuck who is one pissed off crime-boss away from an early grave, to becoming an extremely powerful criminal in their own right. But even then this suffers from the problem of the player being competent at killing in the first place. WOW can feel like you are weak because you are killing kobolds, raptors, and local bandits to start versus murdering Ragnaros at the end; while in GTA there isn't really much difference between a killing horde of gangsters and a horde of soldiers.

Instead I think that games might be able to give you this feeling by their sense of place and the player character's connection to it rather than the player's actual fragility/insignificance within that world. For example: Assassin's Creed Origins. In it you play as someone who exists as an assassin of leaders and kings, and in that case you certainly do not achieve the goal of not being the hero or feeling insignificant. But when the main character Bayek is just playing with children, or helping a father carry grain, or settling a marriage dispute; the game starts to feel less like you are a powerful hero and more like ""Egypt Cop"" (in a good way). Part of it might be that Origins achieves a sense of place incredibly well, but I think part of it is that Bayek feels like a part of the world rather than some force of player will.

Its been brought up before, but STALKER also gives this feeling. In reality, your player can quick-save, heal indefinitely, kill hordes of enemies, and reaches the impossible final goal twice in one life. They are most certainly a hero in the sense that they are able to achieve things much beyond the skill and ability of a normal person. However, STALKER has this constant sense of place by repeatedly reinforcing how terrible living in the exclusion zone is at every turn. You may be able to survive a huge flash of radiation, and can take a couple bullets from an AK without missing a beat; but the game will make you suffer for these things even if they don't kill you. The goal isn't to make the player actually as weak as an NPC would be, but instead make the player feel like they are as weak as an NPC would be.

So I guess my conclusion is to try to keep an eye out for games like this rather than games which can perfectly reflect that feeling of not being a hero/protagonist. That being said, here are some that I find enjoyable that you may as well:

There's an old mac game called ""Escape Velocity: Nova"" that really feels like you are a small part of a living galaxy. Whenever you warp into a system as a small cargo hauler and a war is happening in the background, it really makes you feel like the world exists beyond your screen. Especially when some of those waring ships may decide that they want your cargo and you have to hit hyperspace NOW or you're a dead motherfucker. Its fun, but old.

I think games like Mount and Blade Warband, Battlefront (the original), many Battlefield games, Red Orchestra 2, and Rising Storm 2 can achieve this feeling as well simply by making the player character exist in larger battles and effectively have the same stats as npc's/other players. They do lack the emotion that more story-based games offer, but I find them to be very enjoyable all the same.

I also think that more immersive games like Assassin's Creed Origins, STALKER, Morrowind, or even Far Cry 2 can give this feeling. Although they may in the end make the player feel like a hero character, their sense of place and character connection I think make up for this in spades.

I strongly believe that it will not flop but maybe not reach EAs expectations depending on how harsh they are. I mean even Battlefront 2 (before all the drama was spreading) was ""underperforming"" with I think 9m instead of 10m copies sold, which is IMO ridiculous?",1547125213,1,1547121613.0,Battlefront,0.9956957
5886,832,N1nj4Sp00n,"Well, it might be dying in EA's perspective since they seem to hate triple A games that sell less than a few million copies.
When their IP's get famous but still don't sell like hotcakes they just ditch them, that's why they killed franchises like Medal of Honor and that's why we won't get Dead Space 4 or Mirror's Edge 3 anytime soon and perhaps never.

But yeah, I do agree with you, Battlefield and Battlefront won't ever die, despite not doing as well they expected they still give them a crap ton of money.",1547127562,1,1547123962.0,Battlefront,0.009573653

There is a difference between a shitstorm and actual legal possibilities.",1547200897,1,1547197297.0,Battlefront,0.5923436
5888,834,ARandomPerson15,"I think you are missing the point I am making so I'll lay it out for you.

Gatcha games are scummy for the tactics they use. 

That is the point I am making. I'm sure EA has great explainations for FIFA and Battlefront 2's monitization methods as well, but most people agree that they are scummy. Do you think that FIFA and Battlefront 2 and other ""worse"" gatcha methods are A-ok because well people will buy them? Is Facebook immune from criticism because people still ise the service despite it's flaws? 

I'm not suggesting nor have I ever said this should be banned or the consumer is immune to blame so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up. 

What I'm trying to understand from you is why you keep making excuses for the company and this game. For example with your response below

&gt; They give you apples, and Stamina becomes an issue only after you already played the game for quite some time, at which point it's more about farming events rather than xp cards or items, because you won't always need those. So most of your stamina bar becomes a limitation during events, when they also give you more apples.

Dude they created the broken system. Like the time gate wouldn't exist if they didn't make it. You are justifying them ""mitigating"" the problem, but they created the problem. 

Why not just say something like ""yep those systems exist to exploit FTP players and incentivize spending money"" Like you seem very unwilling to admit that all these companies are just trying to manipulate people and that on a fundamental level is scummy. Not illegal, but let's not pretend they are doing anyone a favor with this system. ",1547251760,1,1547248160.0,Battlefront,0.0012325654

5890,836,ARandomPerson15,"That's all well and good but the practice is at its core predatory and if they wanted to they could make it less predatory. That's just the facts. That other stuff is just PR to me.

I'm sure some MLMs sell ""good"" products and are more fair to their reps. Doesn't change the fact that at its core the practice is corrupt and predatory.

Personally I'd like to see more backlash like Battlefront 2 where the community forces the company to change and embrace fairer models, but as you said Japanese gamers seem glued to this model so it probably won't happen.

I'm not sympathetic to a ""good"" gotcha game at all since as I mentioned there are countless ways they could make it more fair and still keep it F2P but they choose to go with predatory whale hunting tactics.",1547255553,1,1547251953.0,Battlefront,0.026197374
