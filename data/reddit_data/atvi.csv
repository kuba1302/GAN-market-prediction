1,Blenderhead36,"This year, Blizzard:

* Unceremoniously killed the most-anticipated new feature of Hearthstone, tournament mode. It went from a hyped new mode (the first since 2014) and was dumped with an announcement that it wasn't delayed, we've stopped working on it entirely, get fucked. 

* Dropped a new WoW expansion that seems to have the playerbase in revolt. Dubbed ""Beta for Azeroth,"" fans claim it was rough, unfinished, and unpolished, a very un-Blizzard description. 

* Had a disastrous Blizzcon that probably only existed because of how much esports terminates there. The big hype was for Diablo Immortal, a game that people not only didn't want, but actively want to not exist, as shifting to mobile (particularly a farmed out mobile game) is typically an indicator of a lot of scummy practices making their way into the company. The best thing to come out of Blizzcon was Warcraft 3 Reforged, a rerelease of a game from 2002. 

* After three weeks of pros publicly asking if they still had a job, Blizzard announced at 8pm on a Thursday night that their involvement in Heroes of the Storm esports is 100% terminated. Fuck you, enjoy telling your families that your job has been scoured from the face of the Earth over Christmas. In addition, developers are being removed from the game and it is going to be prepped for ""long term stability,"" i.e. maintenance mode. All of this is released in a letter dripping with corporate speak and conveying the impression that both the devs and pros affected by this abrupt discontinuation of service we're notified by this very letter. The devs are being shifted to nebulous ""other projects,"" making it unclear to the playerbase what their game is even being sacrificed for. That HotS was underperforming wasn't exactly news, but to be told so abruptly and insincerely about it's unceremonious dismissal made a bad thing drastically worse. ",1545146647,100,1545143047.0
2,ZGiSH,"A lot of people don't quite know about the history of Heroes of the Storm, but let me just tell you that the development team of HotS was the closest I have seen to a legitimate developer-community connection. It's a shame that HotS just isn't making enough money for Blizzard, it was just on the edge of becoming that next Runescape or Warframe that could set an example of how good communication can lead to a strong playerbase.",1544750980,81,1544747380.0
3,KrushRock,"I'm not sure I buy finances not having a say until now when Blizzard has been monetizing their games pretty heavily, the biggest offender probably being the Auction House in Diablo 3 that happened way back in 2012.

Hearthstone also feels like a cash cow that's just getting more expansions ($$$) and very little, almost none, QoL improvements. People were clamoring for a tournament mode since beta, and at the beginning of this year they finally confirmed they're working on it only to shelve it indefinitely in October. Not to mention other stuff like improving Spectator mode for e-sports, replays, achievements, player profiles, leaderboards,... They're doing bare minimum. 

Overwatch started the lootbox craze and then they tried to implement that into Heroes of the Storm.

Really, the biggest problem seems to be it takes them too long to release games and they're too quick to can stuff. I read about the past versions of Diablo 4, and while I don't think fans would be happy with them as mainline games, I thought they were very interesting concepts for spin-off titles.

They're cutting costs in non-gaming departments and actually hiring more developers. I don't see this as necessarily bad thing, fans might even get more games apart from continuous remasters.",1545424102,64,1545420502.0
4,tehsax,"&gt; Blizzard has been going down this path for almost a decade now, cute how people needed these last few months to see it.

This. I've been saying this for years now. The tipping point for me was a bug in Diablo 3 RoS which caused Radeon HD cards to reliably crash in act 2, always in the same spot. When I took to their forums to report it, I saw that this was not only a known bug, but it had been for months. So far nothing special but they kept closing and deleting new reports about it and the only thing they were doing about it was that the community moderators redirected you to a thread in which someone had posted a workaround: roll back your graphics drivers to a version which was (at that point) 2 years old. Eventually, I found another fix somewhere else on the internet: decompress that gfx driver version into a temporary directory on your HDD, find a specific .dll and put it into the Diablo 3 directory. That was it. That was the fix and Blizzard not only couldn't be arsed to implement a simple fix like this, but they also were actively ignoring it and trying to sweep it under the rug.

This was maybe at the beginning of 2015 and a clear sign that the care and interest for their community had long faded away, because something like this never would've happened with the ""old"" Blizzard. They maybe would've had problems with this bug too, but they wouldn't have tried to make it go away be never talking about it again.

    danklebs,

    Can you post some information about your computer? You can find this information in the Direct X Diagnostic Tool:

    Click on Start
    Click on Run
    Type in: dxdiag (In Vista, type dxdiag in the search field)
    Hit Enter or OK

    Click on the Save All Information button at the bottom, and create a dxdiag text file, and copy and paste it ALL here.



For what? It's been a known problem for about a year now since RoS's release, which pains users with AMD switchable graphics. There are two threads about this on page one alone. The only thing that works is rolling back to AMD drivers from 2013 (13.12 does work, provided you don't use Win 8.1, in which case you could've simply thrown your money in the trash instead of buying D3). The only response from you guys is 'please post your DXdiag' or 'roll back to 13.12', which is plain laughable, especially since I played trough the vanilla game without any problems on the same hardware. Even if it's something in the AMD drivers not working properly, you should be able to get in contact with the AMD guys and figure out what the problem is, but nobody seems to care.

Search for ""desolate sands crash AMD"" in these forums, there are plenty of threads:
http://us.battle.net/d3/en/search?q=desolate+sands+crash+AMD&amp;f=post&amp;forum=5386227

EU forums:
http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/search?q=desolate+sands+crash+AMD&amp;f=post&amp;forum=4436696

German forums:
http://eu.battle.net/d3/de/search?q=die+trostlosen+sande&amp;f=post&amp;forum=4437172

.. and I'm sure, there's a couple of pages about this problem in every language region.

So why even bother going through the hassle of generating a dxdiag file if the only thing you guys do is either suggest going through the standard ""if your computer does something funny""-procedures like reinstalling drivers, etc. or rolling back to a driver that is 2 years old.

I used 13.12 for a while now, but now I got other games complaining about outdated drivers, so I had to decide and since your tech guys obviously can't be arsed to look into this problem, I won't play D3 anymore. I've been buying and playing Blizzard games since Blackhawk for the SNES, every single one. I played WoW for 4 years straight and you guys made hundreds of dollars over the years from my purchases alone. This Bug exists for about a year now and makes the game unplayable for many people, yet the only fix is to use graphics drivers that are so old, it's hard to even find a download. The name 'Blizzard' once stood for a company that cared about their customers, but clearly this has changed over the last couple of years since you fused with Activision and the focus now seems to be solely on the money side of things. As sad as it makes me to say this, but Diablo 3 will be the last game Blizzard sold me. I don't mean to be whining here, I've never complained about any decisions made for your games. But to be let down like this is heartbreaking. Clearly making a quick buck with Heroes of the Storm Heroes and Booster Decks in Hearthstone is now more valuable to Blizzard than the continued support from people for 20 years.",1544867727,54,1544864127.0
5,GalcomMadwell,"Well... to answer your question:

* Unnanounced Diablo Game - presumably Diablo 4 - it started development as a ""Darksouls-like"" but that version was scrapped. They have a new direction for the game that is supposed to return to an emphasis on horror and gore like D1 and D2. See the Kotaku article here: [https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-pulled-diablo-4-announcement-from-bli-1830232246](https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-pulled-diablo-4-announcement-from-bli-1830232246)
* Multiple unannounced mobile games - apparently Blizz devs are big fans of the mobile platform. The article I linked above mentioned one game that is Pokemon Go inspired. 
* Diablo Immortal - despite being developed primarily out-of-house, there are certainly Blizzard developers actively working on this.
* Hearthstone - recently released a new expansion, and IIRC, they always have two or three expansions in active development at various stages of completion.
* Hearthstone mobile app - this is a distinct team, or at least semi-distinct group attached to the HS team.
* World of Warcraft - while the team is not at the scale it was during Legion, there is still huge team working on WoW. They recently released 8.1, and are deep into development on 8.2, and presumably pre-production on the next expansion.
* Heroes of the Storm - there are still staff working on HotS, just less than before.
* Overwatch - obviously developing new content and features at a fairly steady rate. 
* Warcraft 3 Reforged - this is not a massive project, but it's not a one-man project either.
* Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, etc. - ""development complete"" Blizzard games still get small patches, bug fixes, and other updates - Blizzard games are notorious for extremely long-lived support.
* Battle Net - obviously a frequently updated game launcher, website, store, etc. Probably has a decent sized team working on it.
* Other unannounced projects. This last one is a total guess on my part, but I would imagine they have at least one new ""core"" IP in the works, as well as something like Diablo 1 / 2 remastered. 

That is a ton of shit for one company to support. Riot Games, by comparison, has \~2,500 employees but only one game on the market. From what I understand, Riot has made many attempts to develop other games that have gone nowhere.

But to your original point, I think HOTS is definitely a sign of Activisions influence over Blizzard, but HotS has struggled for a long time to build an audience on the scale of other Blizzard games. I'm a huge fan of the game, but it comes as no surprise to me that it's being semi-shuttered.",1544751835,52,1544748235.0
6,DarkRoastJames,"At the end of 2016 I wrote a Gamasutra blog title ""On the eSports Failure of Heroes of the Storm. (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JamesMargaris/20161212/287359/On_the_eSports_Failure_of_Heroes_of_the_Storm.php) It was about why the game failed as an esport - I didn't bother making much of a case for that it had failed, because frankly it was obvious. And that was in 2016. I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.

I see a lot of people, especially on the HOTS sub, saying things like ""why didn't Blizzard market and push it more?"" You market things when you get a return on investment and clearly that wasn't happening with HOTS. A lot of people seem to think that you can make anything a hit through marketing, but sadly that's not the case. HOTS just didn't work as an esport - it has fundamental game design issues that prevent it from working as a highly skill-based competitive game that's compelling to watch.

Events didn't have the best production but I don't think you can pin much blame on the HGC/esports team - the game just wasn't going to work as an esport. To thrive as an esport a game needs to be popular, fun to watch and have a high skill ceiling - HOTS checks none of those boxes. It's a casual game that's designed to smooth over the skill gaps between players rather than accentuate them.

That said, how this was rolled out does seem awfully abrupt. While I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did Blizz really should have given the people involved a heads up, especially when HGC is a major time commitment that prevents people from committing to jobs, schooling, etc. Anyone involved who is surprised that HGC is ending is a bit delusional, but that it's ending like this is surprising even to me.

I once took a late lunch and came back to work to walk in on our project lead asking for ""any questions?"" at the end of a meeting in which everyone had just been laid off. I imagine for HGC players this is a lot like that. ",1544852285,45,1544848685.0

10,crazyfingers619,"I can see it from his perspective.

1. We have one of the ""greatest minds"" from the card game genre like we once did with dota 2 and half life.
2. This is a proven formula we are working with. In every other product feud we've had with blizzard we have both been successful in monetizing our competitors revamped product.
3. The dota brand is strong with a fervent player base.

In every conceivable way, this was aligned for success from the ""Valve"" perspective. If there was a safe bet for a ""return to form"" this would be it.

But gamedev isn't formulaic and it IS pretentious when you think you can just hire some lackys to capture lightning in a bottle for you. The dota characters don't cary much of a narrative or emotional connection. Using a more relatable fantasy type Universe would have evoked a greater sense of wonder. It's ironic because a decade ago valve poked fun of blizzard for shoving their characters into Heroes of the Storm. 

It's a let down that Valve couldn't follow up on pretty much anything the past decade whether it be VR, custom PC consoles, or in home streaming to multiple devices. Now that they were going back to making games I thought maybe they'd pull something at least somewhat impressive off, but it's just not happening. They went from an ambitious company with young talent ready to challenge the status quo to being afraid of any form of change.

The gaming industry is in a collective funk stemming from a scorched earth method of game development. Too successful with monetization for their own good. Didn't foster the right talents at the right times, and no effort has been put into sustained growth.

It boggles the mind how a company can have so much money, squander it hard on several ventures and continuously fuck up so bad. Just a few short years ago there was faith maybe they had some devs whipping up HL3 in secret, putting on their VR helmets and creating the next big thing. What a pipe dream that was. But you have to admit that after their hardware ventures failed, taking a huge gamble on VR didn't make much sense.

As someone who's worked a bit professionally in game dev it's not THAT surprising that these mighty studios fall. The level of dysfunction in this industry created by office politics, backstabbing, greed, brown nosing, petty jealousy, and delusions of grandeur are astounding. Setting up shop in Seattle, the epicenter of social justice, probably drove many of their decent coders and designers to quit if they weren't outright ostracized.

Those rebrandings were certainly ""failures"" in that respect, but the CU and NGE didn't herald the death of SWG. It continued to be run, profitable with subs in the thousands not millions, until the licensing agreement expired for SWTOR to entire the market.

Why they don't they do a Smash Brothers type game?"" 

I look at Heroes of the Storm, and I look at how low-impact everything feels because it is a 5v5 and I can't help but shake my head. Auto-attacks that don't register hit reactions, special abilities that barely do a tenth of the opponent's HP, and ults that can hit an enemy dead-on and not kill them. That's not what I think of those characters. To be fair, the concept of Blizzard doing a MOBA is cool, but I don't think it agreed with Blizzard's core mantras. They don't want to make an ""unfair"" feeling game and being triple-teamed and killed nearly instantly without a chance of hope of surviving if you're out of position is not something Blizzard is willing to put in their games, so right from the get-go their paradigms for how they design games does not agree with how a good MOBA has to be designed to be engaging.

44,[deleted],"I've been playing Blizzard games for 20+ years (started with Warcraft and Diablo). They've been sliding for a long time in my opinion, a lot more than the 1 year you suggested. The closing of [Blizzard North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_North) was the start of the decline for me. 

Some sore points just off the top of my head:

* Starcraft 2 was worse than Starcraft 1. Some may argue otherwise. Splitting the game over 3 parts and then taking several years to release the 2nd and 3rd was a mistake in my opinion.

* Diablo 3 was worse than Diablo 2. I remember when they promised Diablo 3 pvp and arena ""shortly after launch"". It never happened.

* WOTLK was worse than Burning Crusade, and so on. I stopped playing after Cataclysm so I can't speak about further WoW xpacs, but it was a continual decline for me.

* Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm never interested me, they seemed too casual. I played Hearthstone and Overwatch during the betas and had no interest in purchasing them afterwards. I had already played TF2 for years and Overwatch didn't really feel like it brought anything new to the table.

Some younger gamers may not remember, but Blizzard used to offer a [Spawn CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_installation) option on several of their games so that you could play with a friend using a single copy.

&gt;So far, the cost-cutting has mostly taken place in non-gaming departments, with one big exception. Last week, Blizzard announced plans to reduce the staff of Heroes of the Storm and eliminate its esports program. It was a surprising move to those who made their careers off Heroes, but among Blizzard games, this was the weakest link—Heroes of the Storm had always struggled to find as much financial success as Blizzard’s other big hits.

From a more casual perspective, some of this might sound like an overreaction but this can easily be actual doom and gloom. As the eSport scene is now officially dead, the Twitch streamer presence will follow. Top-end players will stop playing making already unbearable queue timers even worse. The backlash will hit the entire community.

They of course put Diablo 3 on a similar ""maintenance"" cycle and that hasn't shown any fruits as of yet. Diablo 3 is also a game primarily played alone or with a few friends, it's not beholden to a metagame from community interaction and teamwork. 

I've played this game since its original alpha stage 4+ years ago and fell in love since. Being a moba fan in general, I loved the faster pace, the varied maps and of course my Blizzard childhood bias didn't harm that either. Sure, they've done silly changes and I've been against the removal of structure ammo, the 2.0 UI rework etc. but all in all as late as last year felt like a stellar year for Heroes of the Storm. 

The writings been on the wall with their complete silence the last few weeks/months and the role rework ramping up queue timers to 5-10+ minutes in ""Quickmatch"" sure can't have helped for the more casual players, but the manner at which this is now told is frankly horrible.

I've spent 200 or so hours playing Rainbow 6 siege this year. I spent a lot of time playing FFXIV as well.

Not that I'm going to pretend to know a lot about E-Sport in any way, nor the development behind it. But at the end of the day, it's a game. And if the game isn't interesting/fun to the majority of your players, the casuals, then it'll probably fail in the end. 

I played HoTS in it's early days of Beta and been playing on and off over the years. Only like a year ago, thanks to a friend, did I really start playing on a somewhat regular basis. Yet the most recent changes as well as the changes that's planned for next year/was planned for next year has made the game much more enjoyable. 

Heck HoTS even has it's own lore now which honestly makes it that bit more interesting to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that's the issue isn't it? How do you strike a good balance between keeping your game entertaining enough for the casual playerbase, while keeping it balanced enough for the hardcore playerbase?

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand (and please correct me if I'm wrong) Overwatch, while one of the most played competitive games currently, is also bleeding due to a stagnant and boring pro scene. 

And honestly I've had no real interest in Overwatch as a game in almost a year now. And I was MEGA hyped when it was announced. A new game/world from Blizzard, one of my favorite story companies? Aww hell YES. 

But there's nothing to draw me back in. Lore is next to non-existing and Heroes are released very slowly. There's no real PVE or story mode to satisfy my interest in the story either. 

So there's only really the constant PVP which becomes quite boring quickly. Even with the constant balancing, reworking and tweaking (which admittedly is very well done) the game rapidly goes back into the same locked position of a stagnant Meta. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Heroes of the Storm has failed as an E-Sport. The obvious reason is the competition of League/Dota, but the game also never felt like it had a real focus. Was it about the Casual content or the Hardcore PVP.

They tried to do something that was different by making a MOBA that focused on something else than the PVP. But it looks like it just never cought on.

Also, the community is also split on the unique match making of the game (you pick a hero and the game finds a match for you, but on ranked it's draft pick), either people want a more balanced team composition (which yields to longer queue times especially that most people want DPS heroes) or faster queue time (which yields to more fuck up team composition as it has lesser time to determine what heroes can suit your pick, player level and more). they tried both and both got a back lash.",1546498398,1,1546494798.0

* StarCraft went F2P a while ago now to try and milk it for what its worth via co-op commander purchases and such, I'm not sure what its player numbers are like though.
* Overwatch's player counts are falling, probably due to the continued popularity of Fortnite among younger players plus the game just aging in general and not being particularly well balanced for competitive play. 
* World of Warcraft's latest expansion sold very quickly but has been criticized for its poor quality, and is likely causing another big drop in player numbers; it is worse-received than Warlords of Draenor, which itself caused an exodus, pushing the sub count down to 5 million from a peak of 10+ million (when it hit 5 million, Blizzard stopped reporting player numbers completely because of bad press).

Personally I used to buy and play every Blizzard game no matter what it was; now I couldn't give less of a shit.

The pace of play is very slow. A turn can take 3 minutes even though you end up playing only 2 cards, and all the animations, screen transitions, etc, are way too slow.

I've played a lot of the game, I like it, but it feels like a game made for math majors who like the idea of probabilistically guiding a complex random system via limited inputs - which just has niche appeal.

1) **World of Warcraft** - One of the most successful games of all time in terms of ROI.  Revenue generated through subscription fees, sales of expansion packs, AND in-game microtransactions for pets, mounts, etc.  

2) **Hearthstone** - A free-to-play game that is almost impossible to be successful at without purchasing card packs or expansions, or insane amounts of luck and grinding to acquire decent cards.  Legendary cards can be incredibly powerful and very rare.  Very successful in terms of ROI.

3) **Heroes of the Storm** - Another free-to-play game where heroes are acquired through grinding or real money.  Basically apes the League of Legends business model and was reasonably successful with it for a while.

4) **Diablo 3** - Four words: real money auction house.  People hated it, so they did away with it after they'd made plenty of money off of it.  Probably their only game that doesn't have a huge continuing revenue stream coming in.  And what's next on the docket for Diablo?  Diablo 4?  Nope, Diablo: Immortal.

5) **Overwatch** - An incredibly high-quality game that releases heroes and maps for free, but generates a ton of revenue by selling cosmetic items in loot boxes.  This should be the what everyone wants, right?  Nope, people still complain about the loot boxes.

This isn't a change of direction.  Blizzard has been trying to maximize profit for years.  Notice that I didn't say any of the games above were bad.  It's possible to put out high quality games while still maintaining a steady stream of revenue post-launch.  Black Ops 4 was praised at launch for its high quality gameplay, but is still lambasted for microtransactions.  Why?  They implemented a system that was better than loot boxes, with mostly cosmetic rewards.  Activision makes exactly two games with microtransactions: Call of Duty and Destiny.  They also created high-quality remakes of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro, and are now remaking CTR.  They're publishing From Software's new game Sekiro, which almost certainly won't have microtransactions.  These are things that gamers want.  So what's the problem?

Activision's direction changed the moment they went public in 1993.  The reality is that any public company has to strive to maximize profit.  You don't have to like it, but that hasn't changed over the last 25 years, and it's not going to change anytime soon.

85,Owyn_Merrilin,"Wow, one single example of an industry which advances more due to technology than actual new ideas. Tell me, what new genres of videogame have come to light in the last 20 years?

First person shooters?

Because those were derivatives of top down shooters like Robotron, especially the early ones like Doom and Duke 3D. If copyright applied to game mechanics (and it doesn't, see Universal V. Nintendo and DaVinci V. Ziko), the genre would have either never been possible, or been literally owned by iD Software after Wolfenstein 3D.

Fighting Games? Well, I hope you like Street Fighter, because if copyright worked the way you wanted it to, there'd be no King of Fighters, no Tekken, no Guilty Gear, and so on and so forth. And that's if Street Fighter itself had been allowed to exist despite the prior existence of games like Kung Fu on the NES.

MOBAs? Well, I hope you like the original DOTA, because that and DOTA 2 are all you're getting. No LoL, no Heroes of the Storm, no Smite, or any other MOBA. Or at least, if the DOTA creators had managed to stake their claim first as most tellings of that story make it out -- in reality there were Starcraft mods that predated the Warcraft 3 mod that most histories will tell you created the genre.

Quite frankly, the games industry has only been able to thrive to the extent that it has because game mechanics are not covered under copyright. If they had, the entire concept of a game genre would have been moot, and things would have stagnated with Pong, Asteroids, and Pitfall.

There is nothing new under the sun, and culture is one long conversation. Nobody can own an idea, and nobody can have an idea if the government artificially enforces an ""ownership"" over the ideas that lead to it. All copyright in its modern form does is allow an ever smaller group of megacorporations to literally own our culture, through laws literally written by the company that owns the largest stake in it -- namely Disney.

* Hearthstone mobile app - this is a distinct team, or at least semi-distinct group attached to the HS team.
* World of Warcraft - while the team is not at the scale it was during Legion, there is still huge team working on WoW. They recently released 8.1, and are deep into development on 8.2, and presumably pre-production on the next expansion.
* Heroes of the Storm - there are still staff working on HotS, just less than before.
* Overwatch - obviously developing new content and features at a fairly steady rate. 
* Warcraft 3 Reforged - this is not a massive project, but it's not a one-man project either.
* Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, etc. - ""development complete"" Blizzard games still get small patches, bug fixes, and other updates - Blizzard games are notorious for extremely long-lived support.
* Battle Net - obviously a frequently updated game launcher, website, store, etc. Probably has a decent sized team working on it.
* Other unannounced projects. This last one is a total guess on my part, but I would imagine they have at least one new ""core"" IP in the works, as well as something like Diablo 1 / 2 remastered.

2. This is a proven formula we are working with. In every other product feud we've had with blizzard we have both been successful in monetizing our competitors revamped product.
3. The dota brand is strong with a fervent player base.

In every conceivable way, this was aligned for success from the ""Valve"" perspective. If there was a safe bet for a ""return to form"" this would be it.

The dota characters don't cary much of a narrative or emotional connection. Using a more relatable fantasy type Universe would have evoked a greater sense of wonder. It's ironic because a decade ago valve poked fun of blizzard for shoving their characters into Heroes of the Storm. 

It's a let down that Valve couldn't follow up on pretty much anything the past decade whether it be VR, custom PC consoles, or in home streaming to multiple devices. Now that they were going back to making games I thought maybe they'd pull something at least somewhat impressive off, but it's just not happening. They went from an ambitious company with young talent ready to challenge the status quo to being afraid of any form of change.

The gaming industry is in a collective funk stemming from a scorched earth method of game development. Too successful with monetization for their own good. Didn't foster the right talents at the right times, and no effort has been put into sustained growth.

It feels like (to me) that we are having the best time for PC gamers with aspects like Xbox Play Anywhere and the Game Pass, we're getting Xbox games on PC that we would have never had a few years back, and then you have games like Forza Horizon that also come with a great selection of settings out of the box, and a decent patching speed to try and remove bugs and address issues. You have Destiny 2 as well, a game that we would have never gotten back in the day, and regardless of your opinons on the game itself, the fact we got it on PC is awesome and it even has an FoV slider. We have Quake Champions which is PC only and Doom that is just mind-blowing and has [Vulkan support](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-doom-vulkan-patch-shows-game-changing-performance-gains)

Heroes of the Storm, Dota, League of Legends all  (Non-Console) games that can sit happily in the top spots on Twitch and draw even more eyes during tournaments. and then you also get games like Total War:Warhammer 2, or  Divinity: Original Sin 2 which was PC first (for close to a year)

And then you have games like Metro: Exodus  which are aiming to include RTX support for the cutting edge PC gamers.

&gt; Blizzard just ended the competitive Heroes of the Storm scene without any warning or anything at all. They are notorius for fucking up their own games.

What they did with HotS was unbelievably stupid but keep in mind they did that because they wanted to focus more of their resources on OWL. I won't even pretend to argue that Blizz is immune to making bad business decision but I think it's a sign that OW is still a major money maker for them. 

&gt; But i think OW has two diffrent people playing the game, the competitive ones and the casual. The competitive scene is failing, while casual one is still going strong. Thats why you get two completly diffrent views on the state of the game.

Blizzard is a top two thing for Activision (the other being CoD).

You'd think it was dangerous to meddle from the outside/top with a group that was being quite a cash cow for you on its own.

As for the whole shareholder thing. Sure. That's always a weird structure that seems to lead to a curious kind of decision making.

I'll say that a thing that stands out in Blizzard's case might be the esports push. They dumped their financing of the Heroes of the Storm scene and people have been questioning their Overwatch League project. I don't know which party fundamentally is responsible for any aspect of those decisions though - Activision or Blizzard.

My ""at worst"" comment up there is because even if projects like that fail, I'm pretty sure Hearthstone, WoW, Overwatch and Diablo 3, even if they might be declining, still are making them a ton of money.


For a long time Activision has been in the game of mostly milking a few big franchises. Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero are dead. CoD remains big. In their 2017 annual report Activision bragged about how huge Destiny (franchise) was for them: ""Second highest grossing console game in North America in 2017"" (CoD being #1). That's gone now.

WoW's expansion quality has been questionable, as it was very clearly released before it was finished (with promises to finish in first major patch, which fell flat). Legitimate grievences from players.

Hearthstone had a rocky 2018, especially the middle expansion which seemed to see a lot streamers calling it quits. From what I've heard of the most recent release, that has calmed down.

Heroes of the Storm was put into maintenance mode, essentially killing future development with a controversial handling of their pro players and associated talent, the ones most dedicated to promoting the game.

Diablo had the fiasco of building up hype leading to BlizzCon, trying to temper those expectations, but still leaving the capstone announcement be a game that is made for an audience that was not at the event.

Even Overwatch has had a lot of dropoff and dissenting voices through 2018 as it lost a lot of ground to Fortnite. I don't hear about how terrible trying to be competitive it is in any game like I hear people griping about Overwatch.

StarCraft 2 had a fantastic year following the free-to-play release and a couple content releases, and an esports performance toppling two decades of precedent.

43,RidlyX,I think Heroes of the Storm players are differently motivated than gacha whales. ,1547228253,1,1547224653.0
44,allas04,"I disagree on that waifu/husbando point. Blizz has a ton of characters people have formed an emotional attachment toward, and can make original characters. Games like FGO, Monster Strike and Granblue have many of their top sellers be original characters. They can also expand their cast by making costumes entirely separate characters like these games did.

Heroes of the Storm was an attempt at this crossover idea as a MOBA, but was too high cost for Blizz and couldn't sustain an e-sport scene. A lower cost mobile title would have lower margin for success.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, the variation in art style, a new game could attract people who don't have a high opinion of the anime-esque art style too potentially. Not everyone likes the art style and voice work of the main popular gacha games. And a lot of gacha games have at least a slight variation in art style. A new gacha game, with a wider variation in art style, might caster a wider net.

OFC, Blizz's main issue is userbase. Western populations typically have large population portions that hate the gacha model. However, Blizzard's games have had success in Korea, China, and Japan before. There might be a userbase and community there willing to do mobile.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I doubt eye candy is the main reason for the appeal. Looking at a PNG image could be done with a Google search, even with the idea of ownership and investment. Many popular characters are also liked for looking 'badass' and not sexy.

One thing I'm curious about with mobile is their cycle rate and retention rate. If the game has high retention and low cycle, it might rely on its community, fanbase, and fan art to bring new users in, and might fall out of favor if it cycles too slowly and as its userbase ages.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I feel gacha doesn't need 'waifu' heavy is Fire Emblem Heroes. Many FE designs are rather plainly drawn 'same face in armor' and only got a few to consider it a waifu game with FE Awakening. This is especially true on the world map that most of games take place in, which has tiny sprites that are almost literally the same and hard to distinguish from each other representing units. FEH did redraws of many old arts to make them more distinctive and tried to use its story to push older and original characters.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest waifu in FE currently is probably Lucina, but even then most of her appeal is likely her personality and old story investment. Lucina dresses plainly, and many eye-candy type waifu fans would likely think she doesn't show enough skin. Though I'm sure there are some 'waifu' fans who like sensible, practical, capable looking designs and feel those look sexy, I doubt those are the majority. I wouldn't call her super distinctive to those 'skin showing waifu' fans. Her body proportions also aren't the ones with the most common appeal. Sure, some do like those proportions, but from anime forums I've seen, the majority prefer big designs and a minority prefer small.

&amp;#x200B;

Gacha has characters be popular for gameplay reasons as well. If an OP unit comes out, people flock to it, often with little complaint because that's how the game typically works. Look at FGO with Merlin, popular even with people who don't think of him as sexy or having much personality, or even not liking the fan doujin memes he's in.

&amp;#x200B;

I think appearance is a small, and often adjustable reason for character popularity. Appearance and voice can change a lot for a piece of artwork, and has changed in many games before, not just gacha games.

Other reasons include character investment in past historical games/series that could get the person invested already.

Character investment from the present story.

And gameplay effect.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think Blizz does have many characters that dress skimpy to appeal to those that enjoy the waifu designs that show a lot of skin. Sylvanas in WOW for example has a rather fan service heavy and distinctive design.

45,TitaniumDragon,"Heroes of the Storm was a legitimately successful game, just not to the level that other Blizzard games were. It had quite a large player base at several points in time.

It was also genuinely good and very accessible.

The problem with HOTS is that most people who get sick of a MOBA get sick of MOBAs in general, so even if it was the best DOTA-like MOBA, if you were already sick of that kind of game, it wouldn't solve that problem.

I liked it better than HOTS and DOTA 2 by a wide margin, with only Awesomenauts competing with it for best MOBA in my eyes.

But HOTS was indeed too late to the market, which is a shame; if it had come out before DOTA 2, it might well have been the second biggest MOBA and might have also helped to rescue the genre from itself.",1547644633,1,1547641033.0
46,caninehere,"I mean I like a good thing to hate as much as the next guy, but Blizzard going downhill just makes me sad.

When I was a kid, Blizzard was my favorite developer. The first game that was ever *mine* was Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, which I got for my 5th birthday. I got all of their games, absolutely loved every one - StarCraft and Diablo II are some of my top all-time games. WarCraft III I didn't like *as* much but it was still really good, and I played WoW at launch and had a great time as a high schooler and have many great memories.

But when they merged with Blizzard, all that started to melt away. I had already stopped playing WoW but I stopped going back for expansions. StarCraft II came and I played it a lot, but it wasn't quite the same and the split campaigns was a bummer since they released them years apart - I never even bothered to play LotV because I didn't care by then, even HotS just had me come back for the campaign and that was it... and they totally fucked the custom game scene in SC2 which was the best thing about SC/War3 for me.

Diablo III was a huge honking disappointment, and though they redeemed it a bit later on with Reaper of Souls, it was never really much of a follow-up to D2. Overwatch came and went, I get why some people enjoy it, but I just really don't care for hero shooters myself and didn't like it much. Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, DLC for all their games... I just stopped caring.

I don't hate Blizzard. It's just a huge fucking bummer what they turned into. They went from being one of my favorite developers (along with Nintendo and late 90s Rareware) to being a company whose games I steer away from.",1549678242,1,1549674642.0
47,Pibb1013,"It’s a perfect storm of things. It’s not that it’s a bad game, it just had a very high bar to reach after over a decade of waiting and Disney seemed to exert a lot of control to the games detriment.

* The game is a spoiler minefield. This is one reason nobody is talking about it, because you kinda can’t.

* Nearly everyone invested in it has grown up, and sees just how corny it is now. 

* It’s not like Red Dead or BotW where it has emergent gameplay and a ton of Easter eggs. It’s the same game for everyone playing. This is a huge thing for sites like this. I’m STILL seeing crazy videos for BOTW but haven’t heard a peep from many other stellar games.

* The lack of FF ANYTHING really bummed out a lot of people, me included. I was shocked that nobody from FF13 onward made it in.

* It’s easy. My god. I’m 10 levels under recommended on proud mode and despite some deaths to shit that is hitting me from offscreen, I’m flying through.

* It didn’t really have a grand finale feel up to the end. The feeling was there in the pre launch hype and in the beginning of the game, but after a few worlds it is less “this is the end” and more “excuse plot to sudden climax”.

* It didn’t feel like they put their heart into casting. Don’t get me wrong. The impersonator they got for Buzz and Sulley are good, and Jim Hanks is always a good woody, but pretty much everyone else they recast just isn’t as good. It’s a big step down from 2 in the regard, which had Bruce Boxleitner, Chris Sarandon, and many others as well as some good impressions for those they didn’t get. Some characters don’t speak at all and it is really awkward and noticeable (Phil, Ralph and Remy for example).

* The best worlds are the ones that are contained stories that feel more like sequels to the movie. Toy Story, Monsters Inc, and Big Hero 6 are much better because of this. The Tangled wordl has me asking my wife every few minutes what is going on because it just isn’t explained. I’ve never seen the movie and they work off the assumption that you know these stories inside and out. 

* Going from there, the bosses just aren’t as impactful. Instead of fighting villains from the movies, you pretty much always fight a rather lame looking, giant heartless. It reeks of Disney being way too protective of their characters.

* There were no surprise worlds that just had came out of left field. KH2 has Steamboat Willie, Tron 1, Mulan, and Lion King. But we still don’t have Emperor’s New Groove, or Lilo &amp; Stitch. Even recents like Increidbles and Wreck it Ralph would have made for better worlds than Frozen, Pirates 3 and Tangled.

There’s a lot more, but I don’t really want to type it all out.  All in all, thee gameplay is really solid and the graphics in some worlds are incredible, but it just seems to lack the same heart that 2 and BBS had. It’s still fun to pal up with some Disney heroes in a side story to their original plots, but it played it too safe and feels more like an advertising vehicle for the newest Disney movies than it does and adventure through timeless classics.",1549680525,1,1549676925.0

As for the whole shareholder thing. Sure. That's always a weird structure that seems to lead to a curious kind of decision making.

I'll say that a thing that stands out in Blizzard's case might be the esports push.

My ""at worst"" comment up there is because even if projects like that fail, I'm pretty sure Hearthstone, WoW, Overwatch and Diablo 3, even if they might be declining, still are making them a ton of money.


For a long time Activision has been in the game of mostly milking a few big franchises. Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero are dead. CoD remains big. In their 2017 annual report Activision bragged about how huge Destiny (franchise) was for them: ""Second highest grossing console game in North America in 2017"" (CoD being #1). That's gone now.

Hearthstone had a rocky 2018, especially the middle expansion which seemed to see a lot streamers calling it quits. From what I've heard of the most recent release, that has calmed down.

Heroes of the Storm was put into maintenance mode, essentially killing future development with a controversial handling of their pro players and associated talent, the ones most dedicated to promoting the game.

Diablo had the fiasco of building up hype leading to BlizzCon, trying to temper those expectations, but still leaving the capstone announcement be a game that is made for an audience that was not at the event.

Even Overwatch has had a lot of dropoff and dissenting voices through 2018 as it lost a lot of ground to Fortnite. I don't hear about how terrible trying to be competitive it is in any game like I hear people griping about Overwatch.

I wouldn't be surprised if the cost of developing Hearthstone v1.0 was less than $900,000.  And this dude's salary and signing bonus probably amount to what it cost to make the present versions of Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, combined.

86,allas04,"I disagree on that waifu/husbando point. Blizz has a ton of characters people have formed an emotional attachment toward, and can make original characters. Games like FGO, Monster Strike and Granblue have many of their top sellers be original characters. They can also expand their cast by making costumes entirely separate characters like these games did.

Heroes of the Storm was an attempt at this crossover idea as a MOBA, but was too high cost for Blizz and couldn't sustain an e-sport scene. A lower cost mobile title would have lower margin for success.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, the variation in art style, a new game could attract people who don't have a high opinion of the anime-esque art style too potentially. Not everyone likes the art style and voice work of the main popular gacha games. And a lot of gacha games have at least a slight variation in art style. A new gacha game, with a wider variation in art style, might caster a wider net.

OFC, Blizz's main issue is userbase. Western populations typically have large population portions that hate the gacha model. However, Blizzard's games have had success in Korea, China, and Japan before. There might be a userbase and community there willing to do mobile.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I doubt eye candy is the main reason for the appeal. Looking at a PNG image could be done with a Google search, even with the idea of ownership and investment. Many popular characters are also liked for looking 'badass' and not sexy.

One thing I'm curious about with mobile is their cycle rate and retention rate. If the game has high retention and low cycle, it might rely on its community, fanbase, and fan art to bring new users in, and might fall out of favor if it cycles too slowly and as its userbase ages.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I feel gacha doesn't need 'waifu' heavy is Fire Emblem Heroes. Many FE designs are rather plainly drawn 'same face in armor' and only got a few to consider it a waifu game with FE Awakening. This is especially true on the world map that most of games take place in, which has tiny sprites that are almost literally the same and hard to distinguish from each other representing units. FEH did redraws of many old arts to make them more distinctive and tried to use its story to push older and original characters.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest waifu in FE currently is probably Lucina, but even then most of her appeal is likely her personality and old story investment. Lucina dresses plainly, and many eye-candy type waifu fans would likely think she doesn't show enough skin. Though I'm sure there are some 'waifu' fans who like sensible, practical, capable looking designs and feel those look sexy, I doubt those are the majority. I wouldn't call her super distinctive to those 'skin showing waifu' fans. Her body proportions also aren't the ones with the most common appeal. Sure, some do like those proportions, but from anime forums I've seen, the majority prefer big designs and a minority prefer small.

&amp;#x200B;

Gacha has characters be popular for gameplay reasons as well. If an OP unit comes out, people flock to it, often with little complaint because that's how the game typically works. Look at FGO with Merlin, popular even with people who don't think of him as sexy or having much personality, or even not liking the fan doujin memes he's in.

&amp;#x200B;

I think appearance is a small, and often adjustable reason for character popularity. Appearance and voice can change a lot for a piece of artwork, and has changed in many games before, not just gacha games.

Other reasons include character investment in past historical games/series that could get the person invested already.

Character investment from the present story.

And gameplay effect.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think Blizz does have many characters that dress skimpy to appeal to those that enjoy the waifu designs that show a lot of skin. Sylvanas in WOW for example has a rather fan service heavy and distinctive design.

The problem with HOTS is that most people who get sick of a MOBA get sick of MOBAs in general, so even if it was the best DOTA-like MOBA, if you were already sick of that kind of game, it wouldn't solve that problem.

I liked it better than HOTS and DOTA 2 by a wide margin, with only Awesomenauts competing with it for best MOBA in my eyes.

Diablo Immortal flat out showed how entirely out of touch they are with their community, how absolutely proud they were to announce a mobile title at their own event as main stage worthy.

This would be annoying, but not entirely insulting if Heroes of the Storm also wasn't abandoned and screwed over pro players/managers after telling them everything was fine before the holidays.

WoW being in possibly the worst state it's been, pissing off majority of it's community. Overwatch having incredibly, incredibly slow balance updates since the release of it.

Their push for e-sports in all their games despite clearly majority of their games NOT being fit for it. Sexual harassment claims from former employees, flat out lying to their customer base.

""Oh we haven't gotten that far with the immortal monetization plan."" finding a literal picture where that exact thing is happening.

Releasing more MTX in the WoW store despite the game lacking content, being buggy and still time-gating things each month.

WoW's expansion quality has been questionable, as it was very clearly released before it was finished (with promises to finish in first major patch, which fell flat). Legitimate grievences from players.

Hearthstone had a rocky 2018, especially the middle expansion which seemed to see a lot streamers calling it quits. From what I've heard of the most recent release, that has calmed down.

Heroes of the Storm was put into maintenance mode, essentially killing future development with a controversial handling of their pro players and associated talent, the ones most dedicated to promoting the game.

Diablo had the fiasco of building up hype leading to BlizzCon, trying to temper those expectations, but still leaving the capstone announcement be a game that is made for an audience that was not at the event.

Even Overwatch has had a lot of dropoff and dissenting voices through 2018 as it lost a lot of ground to Fortnite. I don't hear about how terrible trying to be competitive it is in any game like I hear people griping about Overwatch.

StarCraft 2 had a fantastic year following the free-to-play release and a couple content releases, and an esports performance toppling two decades of precedent. 

When you have a community that is as tight-knit as Blizzard's has been (many will have several if not all the games in Blizzard's launcher installed), lots of small missteps makes big waves.

There are already not enough whales to fund anything other than extremely popular games **or** extremely niche lower-budget games that aim at a target demographic (for example, Star Trek Online continues to make a lot of money despite being 9 years old by delivering a good product to a devoted fan base). 

Plus, Blizzard has been doing this for a while already. It really sucks that the next Diablo is a fucking mobile game, but instead of a new MMO or Diablo 4, we've been getting games-as-service from them for ages now: Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm are all games-as-service.

heroes of the storm esports being forced upon and then closing and I’m expecting overwatch May suffer the same fate eventually.

128,poopington23,"Personally, I've never met Mike and I don't know what is going on with the leadership's minds at Blizzard; like many others, I just hope we get more good games. If they (or others) chase after ""games as service"" (meaning microtransactions, loot boxes, and budget handheld/mobile titles), I'm not going to play them and thus not pay for them. There are already not enough whales to fund anything other than extremely popular games **or** extremely niche lower-budget games that aim at a target demographic (for example, Star Trek Online continues to make a lot of money despite being 9 years old by delivering a good product to a devoted fan base). 

Plus, Blizzard has been doing this for a while already. It really sucks that the next Diablo is a fucking mobile game, but instead of a new MMO or Diablo 4, we've been getting games-as-service from them for ages now: Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm are all games-as-service. Even Starcraft II and the upcoming Warcraft 3 remake are games-as-service in that they are e-sports. 

Having said all that, I'm not sure how much credence I would give this story. The ""journalist"" Richard Lewis has an unnamed source **and** used to work for a ""news"" website well known for making things up to create far-right propaganda and drive web traffic. It is normal for journalists to have unnamed sources, but this one worked for a website known for making up stories with made up sources. That doesn't mean that the story is definitely invented bullshit, but you can't go from working for the equivalent of the racist, hateful version of the National Enquirer and then be expected to be taken seriously as a journalist. Basically, I won't believe this until a named source or a journalist with integrity confirms it. It amazes me that he found work as an esports caster after making such a bad career choice.

That's on top of a $900,000 salary.

I wouldn't be surprised if the cost of developing Hearthstone v1.0 was less than $900,000.  And this dude's salary and signing bonus probably amount to what it cost to make the present versions of Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, combined.

The two concepts get confused because the industry has done a relatively poor job with the ""Games as a Service"" concept RECENTLY, and continue to release ""version 1"" of said games as incomplete products.  As we saw with both Destiny games (and now Anthem), the game floundered in PRE-PROD for multiple years, then the development teams rushed to get version 1 out the door.  That is a completely different problem and NOT what Games as a Service actually encompasses.

There are many, many examples of GaaS done right.  The concept is simply a development &amp; monetization method, it has NOTHING to do with poor release products.

Games as a Service done right:

Nearly every popular fantasy MMO from the past 20 years.

Heroes of the Storm
LoL
Dota 2
Borderlands 1
Borderlands 2 
Ghost Recon Wildlands
Fortnite

That is a completely different topic, because what im talking about is actual content, what you are talking about is cosmetics.

But ill entertain your thought and say, no i obviously dont, but i also dont play any games with these kind of schemes aside from Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, which both have rather reasonable F2P standards and cosmetic only micro transactions. No content is paywalled and i wouldnt play a game that has that.

&gt;Would you refuse to play a F2P game unless you could afford to instantly buy every item they have available to buy?

No not even then, i would basically just not play it if it has content behind a paywall.

Dude, seriously, why are you so up in arms against my personal opinion?

&gt;If not... then why apply that attitude here?

Wrong and wrong, because it is perfectly applicable.

&gt;Which means this game will never be ""a full product"" in your eyes... and that makes no sense.

It still makes sense if you actually think about it. Look towards Smite, where you can spend 30€ once and get all new hero releases for free, this basically means you never have to pay a cent for upcoming content since everything but heroes and cosmetics which i dont count, is available to everyone.

And to go further on this example, if they would atleast release a Collection of some sort that includes everything up to a certain point into one cohesive package, that would be atleast a step in the right direction. And i mean atleast a yearly if not multi-year package.

&gt;You're not going against a practice by not buying it

I actually am, because the only way to show your opinion is basically with your wallet, if people dont buy because they arent happy with the content, it means less sales and therefore a noticeable displeasure among consumers.

You try to frame it as ""its just you"" but it isnt, there are many people that complained about the exact same thing since Sims 3 all over reddit and many other forums or community spaces.

&gt;you're just saying you don't want to play The Sims, and finding a reason to try to justify it.

That is just conjecture on your part, since i own the Sims 1 and 2 complete edition in their original box and i own Sims 3 base game and stopped after that because i started to be extremely unhappy with their DLC practice.

Just because you dont like my opinion, doesnt mean its worth less than yours... come down from your high horse...

&gt;But I guess you'd never want to touch them as they'll never be ""full products.""

Thats correct, also im not interested in games like Crusader Kinds II, so that point is moot again.

&gt;I'd recommend staying away from MMOs, too, they like to release expansions, so you'd have to pay more and more for the ""full product.""

Im not playing any MMO and im not interested in them in any way, because of the previously mentioned reasons.

Why are you trying to frame me as oblivious or an airhead because you dislike my opinion?

&gt;I can't imagine how much you would be spending on a game like Assassin's Creed: Odyssey... Oof. Would be expensive to get that ""full product.""

I havent gotten it yet, because i wait for the complete edition, like i did with Origins, which i paid 35€ for, so thank you very much for pointing out the obvious again.

So aside from a lot of hot air and anger, did you have any reasonable point? Let me check:

* No

52,sebaajhenza,"Brain drain. No, I don't think so. What's happened is that AAA titles simply cost to much to fail. No publisher is willing to take big risks.

Make no mistake, with these big publishers any decision to go ahead with a big game comes down to the return on investment for the shareholders. They wouldn't give a shit what the story arc or gameplay is like as long as they hit their bottom line.

They buy out any studios with an iota of talent. Sign them up to ridiculous release cycles and essentially pump out title after title until the studio collapses. The they buy the next hot property. 

This is very similar to how the advertising industry works; Buy the little guys for their clients, drive them into the ground gobbling up as much profit as possible on the way down, then when the clients move to a new company - buy that. Rinse, repeat.

Hollywood moved to this model sometime ago too. Pump out generic movie #1, #2 &amp; #3 for the quick bucks. When #4 makes a loss, ditch the franchise and move on to the next piece of shit film design by committee. They don't risk any money on anything unproven. You end up with soulless drivel designed by focus groups and market research.

The problem is the cost of development. If you had a legitimate amazing game idea that you wanted to bring to life in a AAA game; think about how much capital you would need to hire the developers, engine licenses, content, maps, 3d art, texturing, lighting, networking, sound, programming, concept art, music composition, voice acting, mo-cap, other random licenses for software tools like scaleform, plus project managers, senior staff and leadership, HR, marketing, etc.

There is simply no way to do this without investment from somewhere. At that point you're at the whim of whoever is funding you.

Crowd funding was a glimmer of hope when Star Citizen first came onto the scene - but that has dragged on for so long now it's proven that's not really a viable path either.

The best thing you can do, in my mind; is support as many weird and whacky modestly built Indy games. Rest assured if any Indy game gets a lot of buzz, the AAA copy cat with more polish is only around the corner.

The two concepts get confused because the industry has done a relatively poor job with the ""Games as a Service"" concept RECENTLY, and continue to release ""version 1"" of said games as incomplete products.  As we saw with both Destiny games (and now Anthem), the game floundered in PRE-PROD for multiple years, then the development teams rushed to get version 1 out the door.  That is a completely different problem and NOT what Games as a Service actually encompasses.

There are many, many examples of GaaS done right.  The concept is simply a development &amp; monetization method, it has NOTHING to do with poor release products.

Ghost Recon Wildlands

On its own, this isn't a bad idea. Blizzard threw a lot of good money at bad ideas, including all the money they sunk into trying to take over the MOBA market with Heroes of the Storm, when Riot and Valve were already in such a dominant position. Likewise with the huge amounts of money they sank into esports, when the only one of their titles with any traction there is Overwatch (and who knows how much of that is genuine interest, and how much of that is the result of spending insane amounts of Blizzard Bucks.)

Getting back to working on content for their most popular titles is not, on its own, a bad idea. (Maybe they'll actually assign enough developers to Hearthstone to kill the ""small indie developer"" meme?)

76,Lonewanderer08,"&gt;Do you buy every microtransaction available for every game you get?

Yes, i only buy GOTY or Gold editions that include all DLC. I hate piece meal content, id rather wait and pay a reasonable amount to get everything at once at my leasure than to go back and forth between content releases and spend more and more money on a game.

&gt;Would you drop thousands of dollars on lootboxes in Overwatch to unlock every single item?

That is a completely different topic, because what im talking about is actual content, what you are talking about is cosmetics.

But ill entertain your thought and say, no i obviously dont, but i also dont play any games with these kind of schemes aside from Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, which both have rather reasonable F2P standards and cosmetic only micro transactions. No content is paywalled and i wouldnt play a game that has that.

&gt;Would you refuse to play a F2P game unless you could afford to instantly buy every item they have available to buy?

No not even then, i would basically just not play it if it has content behind a paywall.

Dude, seriously, why are you so up in arms against my personal opinion?

&gt;If not... then why apply that attitude here?

Wrong and wrong, because it is perfectly applicable.

&gt;Which means this game will never be ""a full product"" in your eyes... and that makes no sense.

It still makes sense if you actually think about it. Look towards Smite, where you can spend 30€ once and get all new hero releases for free, this basically means you never have to pay a cent for upcoming content since everything but heroes and cosmetics which i dont count, is available to everyone.

And to go further on this example, if they would atleast release a Collection of some sort that includes everything up to a certain point into one cohesive package, that would be atleast a step in the right direction. And i mean atleast a yearly if not multi-year package.

&gt;You're not going against a practice by not buying it

I actually am, because the only way to show your opinion is basically with your wallet, if people dont buy because they arent happy with the content, it means less sales and therefore a noticeable displeasure among consumers.

You try to frame it as ""its just you"" but it isnt, there are many people that complained about the exact same thing since Sims 3 all over reddit and many other forums or community spaces.

&gt;you're just saying you don't want to play The Sims, and finding a reason to try to justify it.

That is just conjecture on your part, since i own the Sims 1 and 2 complete edition in their original box and i own Sims 3 base game and stopped after that because i started to be extremely unhappy with their DLC practice.

Just because you dont like my opinion, doesnt mean its worth less than yours... come down from your high horse...

&gt;But I guess you'd never want to touch them as they'll never be ""full products.""

Thats correct, also im not interested in games like Crusader Kinds II, so that point is moot again.

&gt;I'd recommend staying away from MMOs, too, they like to release expansions, so you'd have to pay more and more for the ""full product.""

Im not playing any MMO and im not interested in them in any way, because of the previously mentioned reasons.

Why are you trying to frame me as oblivious or an airhead because you dislike my opinion?

&gt;I can't imagine how much you would be spending on a game like Assassin's Creed: Odyssey... Oof. Would be expensive to get that ""full product.""

I havent gotten it yet, because i wait for the complete edition, like i did with Origins, which i paid 35€ for, so thank you very much for pointing out the obvious again.

108,sebaajhenza,"Brain drain. No, I don't think so. What's happened is that AAA titles simply cost to much to fail. No publisher is willing to take big risks.

Make no mistake, with these big publishers any decision to go ahead with a big game comes down to the return on investment for the shareholders. They wouldn't give a shit what the story arc or gameplay is like as long as they hit their bottom line.

They buy out any studios with an iota of talent. Sign them up to ridiculous release cycles and essentially pump out title after title until the studio collapses. The they buy the next hot property. 

This is very similar to how the advertising industry works; Buy the little guys for their clients, drive them into the ground gobbling up as much profit as possible on the way down, then when the clients move to a new company - buy that. Rinse, repeat.

Hollywood moved to this model sometime ago too. Pump out generic movie #1, #2 &amp; #3 for the quick bucks. When #4 makes a loss, ditch the franchise and move on to the next piece of shit film design by committee. They don't risk any money on anything unproven. You end up with soulless drivel designed by focus groups and market research.

The problem is the cost of development. If you had a legitimate amazing game idea that you wanted to bring to life in a AAA game; think about how much capital you would need to hire the developers, engine licenses, content, maps, 3d art, texturing, lighting, networking, sound, programming, concept art, music composition, voice acting, mo-cap, other random licenses for software tools like scaleform, plus project managers, senior staff and leadership, HR, marketing, etc.

There is simply no way to do this without investment from somewhere. At that point you're at the whim of whoever is funding you.

Crowd funding was a glimmer of hope when Star Citizen first came onto the scene - but that has dragged on for so long now it's proven that's not really a viable path either.

The best thing you can do, in my mind; is support as many weird and whacky modestly built Indy games. Rest assured if any Indy game gets a lot of buzz, the AAA copy cat with more polish is only around the corner.

122,sunfurypsu,"I get what the author is trying to say, but his entire ""analysis"" has a critical flaw. - Games as a Service is a concept whereas a game is updated and monetized OVER time.  GaaS has absolutely nothing to do, fundamentally, with the ""foundation"" game (the first release) being skinny (or without content).  

The two concepts get confused because the industry has done a relatively poor job with the ""Games as a Service"" concept RECENTLY, and continue to release ""version 1"" of said games as incomplete products.  As we saw with both Destiny games (and now Anthem), the game floundered in PRE-PROD for multiple years, then the development teams rushed to get version 1 out the door.  That is a completely different problem and NOT what Games as a Service actually encompasses.

There are many, many examples of GaaS done right.  The concept is simply a development &amp; monetization method, it has NOTHING to do with poor release products.

Games as a Service done right:

Nearly every popular fantasy MMO from the past 20 years.
Hearthstone
Heroes of the Storm
LoL
Dota 2
Borderlands 1
Borderlands 2 
Ghost Recon Wildlands
Fortnite
Killing Floor 2 (Sat in early access for a long time, but release version was a complete game.)
Battletech


The list goes on. Youtubers, and critics like Jim Sterling, have the masses whipped up in a frenzy against GaaS.  What they don't understand is that they are complaining about the wrong thing.  The ""problem"" with Games as a Service isn't the concept, its the recent underbaked titles that companies have called ""service based"" games.

Getting back to working on content for their most popular titles is not, on its own, a bad idea. (Maybe they'll actually assign enough developers to Hearthstone to kill the ""small indie developer"" meme?)

131,Lonewanderer08,"&gt;Do you buy every microtransaction available for every game you get?

Yes, i only buy GOTY or Gold editions that include all DLC. I hate piece meal content, id rather wait and pay a reasonable amount to get everything at once at my leasure than to go back and forth between content releases and spend more and more money on a game.

&gt;Would you drop thousands of dollars on lootboxes in Overwatch to unlock every single item?

That is a completely different topic, because what im talking about is actual content, what you are talking about is cosmetics.

But ill entertain your thought and say, no i obviously dont, but i also dont play any games with these kind of schemes aside from Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, which both have rather reasonable F2P standards and cosmetic only micro transactions. No content is paywalled and i wouldnt play a game that has that.

&gt;Would you refuse to play a F2P game unless you could afford to instantly buy every item they have available to buy?

No not even then, i would basically just not play it if it has content behind a paywall.

Dude, seriously, why are you so up in arms against my personal opinion?

&gt;If not... then why apply that attitude here?

Wrong and wrong, because it is perfectly applicable.

&gt;Which means this game will never be ""a full product"" in your eyes... and that makes no sense.

It still makes sense if you actually think about it. Look towards Smite, where you can spend 30€ once and get all new hero releases for free, this basically means you never have to pay a cent for upcoming content since everything but heroes and cosmetics which i dont count, is available to everyone.

And to go further on this example, if they would atleast release a Collection of some sort that includes everything up to a certain point into one cohesive package, that would be atleast a step in the right direction. And i mean atleast a yearly if not multi-year package.

&gt;You're not going against a practice by not buying it

I actually am, because the only way to show your opinion is basically with your wallet, if people dont buy because they arent happy with the content, it means less sales and therefore a noticeable displeasure among consumers.

You try to frame it as ""its just you"" but it isnt, there are many people that complained about the exact same thing since Sims 3 all over reddit and many other forums or community spaces.

&gt;you're just saying you don't want to play The Sims, and finding a reason to try to justify it.

That is just conjecture on your part, since i own the Sims 1 and 2 complete edition in their original box and i own Sims 3 base game and stopped after that because i started to be extremely unhappy with their DLC practice.

Just because you dont like my opinion, doesnt mean its worth less than yours... come down from your high horse...

&gt;But I guess you'd never want to touch them as they'll never be ""full products.""

Thats correct, also im not interested in games like Crusader Kinds II, so that point is moot again.

&gt;I'd recommend staying away from MMOs, too, they like to release expansions, so you'd have to pay more and more for the ""full product.""

Im not playing any MMO and im not interested in them in any way, because of the previously mentioned reasons.

Why are you trying to frame me as oblivious or an airhead because you dislike my opinion?

&gt;I can't imagine how much you would be spending on a game like Assassin's Creed: Odyssey... Oof. Would be expensive to get that ""full product.""

I havent gotten it yet, because i wait for the complete edition, like i did with Origins, which i paid 35€ for, so thank you very much for pointing out the obvious again.

163,sebaajhenza,"Brain drain. No, I don't think so. What's happened is that AAA titles simply cost to much to fail. No publisher is willing to take big risks.

Make no mistake, with these big publishers any decision to go ahead with a big game comes down to the return on investment for the shareholders. They wouldn't give a shit what the story arc or gameplay is like as long as they hit their bottom line.

They buy out any studios with an iota of talent. Sign them up to ridiculous release cycles and essentially pump out title after title until the studio collapses. The they buy the next hot property. 

This is very similar to how the advertising industry works; Buy the little guys for their clients, drive them into the ground gobbling up as much profit as possible on the way down, then when the clients move to a new company - buy that. Rinse, repeat.

Hollywood moved to this model sometime ago too. Pump out generic movie #1, #2 &amp; #3 for the quick bucks. When #4 makes a loss, ditch the franchise and move on to the next piece of shit film design by committee. They don't risk any money on anything unproven. You end up with soulless drivel designed by focus groups and market research.

The problem is the cost of development. If you had a legitimate amazing game idea that you wanted to bring to life in a AAA game; think about how much capital you would need to hire the developers, engine licenses, content, maps, 3d art, texturing, lighting, networking, sound, programming, concept art, music composition, voice acting, mo-cap, other random licenses for software tools like scaleform, plus project managers, senior staff and leadership, HR, marketing, etc.

There is simply no way to do this without investment from somewhere. At that point you're at the whim of whoever is funding you.

Crowd funding was a glimmer of hope when Star Citizen first came onto the scene - but that has dragged on for so long now it's proven that's not really a viable path either.

The best thing you can do, in my mind; is support as many weird and whacky modestly built Indy games. Rest assured if any Indy game gets a lot of buzz, the AAA copy cat with more polish is only around the corner.

175,sunfurypsu,"I get what the author is trying to say, but his entire ""analysis"" has a critical flaw. - Games as a Service is a concept whereas a game is updated and monetized OVER time.  GaaS has absolutely nothing to do, fundamentally, with the ""foundation"" game (the first release) being skinny (or without content).  

The two concepts get confused because the industry has done a relatively poor job with the ""Games as a Service"" concept RECENTLY, and continue to release ""version 1"" of said games as incomplete products.  As we saw with both Destiny games (and now Anthem), the game floundered in PRE-PROD for multiple years, then the development teams rushed to get version 1 out the door.  That is a completely different problem and NOT what Games as a Service actually encompasses.

There are many, many examples of GaaS done right.  The concept is simply a development &amp; monetization method, it has NOTHING to do with poor release products.

Games as a Service done right:

Nearly every popular fantasy MMO from the past 20 years.
Hearthstone
Heroes of the Storm
LoL
Dota 2
Borderlands 1
Borderlands 2 
Ghost Recon Wildlands
Fortnite
Killing Floor 2 (Sat in early access for a long time, but release version was a complete game.)
Battletech


The list goes on. Youtubers, and critics like Jim Sterling, have the masses whipped up in a frenzy against GaaS.  What they don't understand is that they are complaining about the wrong thing.

Yes, i only buy GOTY or Gold editions that include all DLC. I hate piece meal content, id rather wait and pay a reasonable amount to get everything at once at my leasure than to go back and forth between content releases and spend more and more money on a game.

&gt;Would you drop thousands of dollars on lootboxes in Overwatch to unlock every single item?

That is a completely different topic, because what im talking about is actual content, what you are talking about is cosmetics.

But ill entertain your thought and say, no i obviously dont, but i also dont play any games with these kind of schemes aside from Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, which both have rather reasonable F2P standards and cosmetic only micro transactions. No content is paywalled and i wouldnt play a game that has that.

&gt;Would you refuse to play a F2P game unless you could afford to instantly buy every item they have available to buy?

No not even then, i would basically just not play it if it has content behind a paywall.

Dude, seriously, why are you so up in arms against my personal opinion?

&gt;If not... then why apply that attitude here?

Wrong and wrong, because it is perfectly applicable.

&gt;Which means this game will never be ""a full product"" in your eyes... and that makes no sense.

It still makes sense if you actually think about it. Look towards Smite, where you can spend 30€ once and get all new hero releases for free, this basically means you never have to pay a cent for upcoming content since everything but heroes and cosmetics which i dont count, is available to everyone.

And to go further on this example, if they would atleast release a Collection of some sort that includes everything up to a certain point into one cohesive package, that would be atleast a step in the right direction. And i mean atleast a yearly if not multi-year package.

&gt;You're not going against a practice by not buying it

I actually am, because the only way to show your opinion is basically with your wallet, if people dont buy because they arent happy with the content, it means less sales and therefore a noticeable displeasure among consumers.

You try to frame it as ""its just you"" but it isnt, there are many people that complained about the exact same thing since Sims 3 all over reddit and many other forums or community spaces.

&gt;you're just saying you don't want to play The Sims, and finding a reason to try to justify it.

That is just conjecture on your part, since i own the Sims 1 and 2 complete edition in their original box and i own Sims 3 base game and stopped after that because i started to be extremely unhappy with their DLC practice.

Just because you dont like my opinion, doesnt mean its worth less than yours... come down from your high horse...

&gt;But I guess you'd never want to touch them as they'll never be ""full products.""

Thats correct, also im not interested in games like Crusader Kinds II, so that point is moot again.

&gt;I'd recommend staying away from MMOs, too, they like to release expansions, so you'd have to pay more and more for the ""full product.""

Im not playing any MMO and im not interested in them in any way, because of the previously mentioned reasons.

Why are you trying to frame me as oblivious or an airhead because you dislike my opinion?

&gt;I can't imagine how much you would be spending on a game like Assassin's Creed: Odyssey... Oof. Would be expensive to get that ""full product.""

I havent gotten it yet, because i wait for the complete edition, like i did with Origins, which i paid 35€ for, so thank you very much for pointing out the obvious again.

So aside from a lot of hot air and anger, did you have any reasonable point? Let me check:

How can that be true? Let's go over the list of Blizzard's current titles:

* Heroes of the storm - On Maintenance Mode
* Diablo 3 - Nothing new since the Necromancer was released in July 2017. No Cash shop either.
* Hearthstone - I have no idea how well this is doing these days. I quit a long time ago.
* Overwatch - I've read it's failing as an eSport and it's playbase has shrunk substantially in the last 6 months.

204,sebaajhenza,"Brain drain. No, I don't think so. What's happened is that AAA titles simply cost to much to fail. No publisher is willing to take big risks.

Make no mistake, with these big publishers any decision to go ahead with a big game comes down to the return on investment for the shareholders. They wouldn't give a shit what the story arc or gameplay is like as long as they hit their bottom line.

They buy out any studios with an iota of talent. Sign them up to ridiculous release cycles and essentially pump out title after title until the studio collapses. The they buy the next hot property. 

This is very similar to how the advertising industry works; Buy the little guys for their clients, drive them into the ground gobbling up as much profit as possible on the way down, then when the clients move to a new company - buy that. Rinse, repeat.

Hollywood moved to this model sometime ago too. Pump out generic movie #1, #2 &amp; #3 for the quick bucks. When #4 makes a loss, ditch the franchise and move on to the next piece of shit film design by committee. They don't risk any money on anything unproven. You end up with soulless drivel designed by focus groups and market research.

The problem is the cost of development. If you had a legitimate amazing game idea that you wanted to bring to life in a AAA game; think about how much capital you would need to hire the developers, engine licenses, content, maps, 3d art, texturing, lighting, networking, sound, programming, concept art, music composition, voice acting, mo-cap, other random licenses for software tools like scaleform, plus project managers, senior staff and leadership, HR, marketing, etc.

There is simply no way to do this without investment from somewhere. At that point you're at the whim of whoever is funding you.

Crowd funding was a glimmer of hope when Star Citizen first came onto the scene - but that has dragged on for so long now it's proven that's not really a viable path either.

The best thing you can do, in my mind; is support as many weird and whacky modestly built Indy games. Rest assured if any Indy game gets a lot of buzz, the AAA copy cat with more polish is only around the corner.

Dude, seriously, why are you so up in arms against my personal opinion?

&gt;If not... then why apply that attitude here?

Wrong and wrong, because it is perfectly applicable.

&gt;Which means this game will never be ""a full product"" in your eyes... and that makes no sense.

It still makes sense if you actually think about it. Look towards Smite, where you can spend 30€ once and get all new hero releases for free, this basically means you never have to pay a cent for upcoming content since everything but heroes and cosmetics which i dont count, is available to everyone.

And to go further on this example, if they would atleast release a Collection of some sort that includes everything up to a certain point into one cohesive package, that would be atleast a step in the right direction. And i mean atleast a yearly if not multi-year package.

&gt;You're not going against a practice by not buying it

I actually am, because the only way to show your opinion is basically with your wallet, if people dont buy because they arent happy with the content, it means less sales and therefore a noticeable displeasure among consumers.

You try to frame it as ""its just you"" but it isnt, there are many people that complained about the exact same thing since Sims 3 all over reddit and many other forums or community spaces.

&gt;you're just saying you don't want to play The Sims, and finding a reason to try to justify it.

That is just conjecture on your part, since i own the Sims 1 and 2 complete edition in their original box and i own Sims 3 base game and stopped after that because i started to be extremely unhappy with their DLC practice.

Just because you dont like my opinion, doesnt mean its worth less than yours... come down from your high horse...

&gt;But I guess you'd never want to touch them as they'll never be ""full products.""

Thats correct, also im not interested in games like Crusader Kinds II, so that point is moot again.

&gt;I'd recommend staying away from MMOs, too, they like to release expansions, so you'd have to pay more and more for the ""full product.""

Im not playing any MMO and im not interested in them in any way, because of the previously mentioned reasons.

Why are you trying to frame me as oblivious or an airhead because you dislike my opinion?

&gt;I can't imagine how much you would be spending on a game like Assassin's Creed: Odyssey... Oof. Would be expensive to get that ""full product.""

I havent gotten it yet, because i wait for the complete edition, like i did with Origins, which i paid 35€ for, so thank you very much for pointing out the obvious again.

So aside from a lot of hot air and anger, did you have any reasonable point? Let me check:

* No

* No

* No

* No

* Oh an No

You are free to agree with me, but you should really work on your anger issues and your ""im quite a dick"" issues :)",1550779347,1,1550775747.0

It sucks for those affected just like it sucks when every major studio does a good chunk of layoffs after they release a game.

A time sink has nothing to do with service based games. A time sink is a specific design choice. A service game can easily exist, WITHOUT being a time sink. Hearthstone is a prime example. Additionally, half the service based games that people claim are time sinks, are not. People CHOOSE to make them time sinks.

You have literally no data to back up either of those claims, and the only data I can pull for Overwatch is generalizations of say Twitch views, price decrease etc.

Once again, being on Steam isn't necessary to make it, it just makes it easier.  Battlefield V crashed and burned on Origin, for instance, but it may have sold way more copies if it was available in more places.

Who laid off a bunch of their game-making staff.

&gt;TCG

In a market saturated with them already. Same problem Heroes of the Storm faced, and a bunch of Battle Royale games. They think it's a dumb formula that works. When really, as a producer, you have to ask, ""Why would a longtime Fortnite player set aside Fortnite to play my Battle Royale?"" A lot of BR games have failed to answer that. Why would someone play Artifact over Hearthstone or Magic or Gwent?

&gt;based on Dota 2 lore

Forgive me for sounding insensitive, but I fail to see how this is a marketable commodity. Dota players and the community to my knowledge do not rally around the game's lore the way that, say, Mass Effect does. Gwent gets away with a shitton because it's based off a game where people care about the lore. Most people, when it comes to Dota...don't.

&gt;built for e-sports

Call me crazy, but in the same way that millions of pickup basketball players never dream of going pro, making a game ""for professionals"" feels like you're instantly cutting out a chunk of your market. Most players, I would wager, are casual. Or, rather, a game has to have some appeal to them. Again, Heroes of the Storm kind of faced this problem, to my knowledge.",1553919106,1,1553915506.0

0,SharkyIzrod,"This really shows why r/Games is rarely representative of any larger group of people. 

Firstly, the Diablo: Immortal announcement is the only time there has been a negatively received announcement at BlizzCon. Not the first time it has happened to this degree, the first time it has happened *ever*. That is to say, people going to BlizzCon are Blizzard fans. Not 2003 Blizzard fans, not 2008 Blizzard fans, they are current Blizzard fans. Maybe they enjoy SC2. Maybe they enjoy WoW retail. maybe they enjoy Overwatch. Hearthstone. Heroes of the Storm. Diablo III. Any mix of those. But they like current Blizzard's products.

Beyond that, the Opening Ceremony is by far the most hype portion of the event. **But** it is only the first hour of two full days. People go there for the OW World Cup, for the SC2 WCS, for the WoW Arena finals, for the playable demos of future content/releases, for the panels, for the other esports events, for the opportunity to meet their guild mates, teammates, Battle.net friends, etc. BlizzCon is a lot more than just the opening ceremony. 

So let me give you my take, then. As a Blizzard fan, BlizzCon is two of my favorite days each year. I get to share my favorite game and esport ever with a large crowd and with my father, with whom it has become a father-son experience to go there together. He introduced me to SC1 way back when, and I introduced him to WCS sometime in the early 2010s. Today, I can't imagine a year where we don't watch the WCS finals together. Growing up with Blizzard games means more to me than having played them before, it has defined relationships with many people for me. 

With that cleared up, I can easily say 2018's Opening Ceremony was the most disappointing one I've ever watched or attended live. The rest of the two days of BlizzCon 2018, however, remain two of my favorite days of last year. Getting to watch Serral become the first non-Korean SC2 champion (even though I was rooting for Stats), getting to play WC3R and talk about it to friends I have who grew up with that game alongside me or bonded with me over it in college, getting to see a live Pylon Show, getting to hear the people behind some of my favorite games ever talk about them and get interviewed by Day[9] all makes it worth it.

Do I wish 2018's opening ceremony didn't go the way it did? Sure. Am I excited for Diablo: Immortal? No. Am I worried that the Opening Ceremony for 2019 might also be disappointing? Of course. But am I going to BlizzCon 2019? Fuck yes I am.",1556653125,18,1556649525.0
1,Klondeikbar,"&gt;Elysian Caches were special loot chests that appeared at the end of Stronghold missions and had unique cosmetics like decals and fabric textures inside. They were originally added to the game in a March 26 update, the game’s first major new piece of content since its February release. The cosmetics inside the chests weren’t fantastic, but they did give players an additional reason to keep running through the same old content over and over again.

I really despise how developers just flood their lootboxes with trash. They lock their cosmetics inside gambling boxes and *still* don't want to actually give you anything good . Overwatch was another *huge* offender. I shouldn't be getting sprays a blind child could make in MS paint.

8,Alinosburns,"Yeah, which holds true for storm troopers and that's about it.

The imperial navy's uniform is largely dress uniform, which may change from organisation to organisation. But when the imperial navy is largely ship bound, there is no need for less formal wear. They don't need camo patterns or the like because that's not something you would necessarily worry about when you have your army contingent of storm troopers etc.

I totally get diverting from the clone/storm trooper armour, but even that can only go so far until you are making it different for the sake of it not looking like storm trooper armour. Especially because you have things like mandalorian culture which have prized their armour for generations and as a result only minor modifications are made.

And despite how they are presented in the movies, it's never really clear if the storm troopers are all actually killed everytime they are shot, or if taking a laser blast to the armour is the equivalent of taking a kinetic weapon to a bullet proof vest. We rarely linger on those things because the heroes are moving on from location to location. And the few times we do, like the first order soldier leaving blood on Finn, they are hit with the equivalent of a sniper rifle, which would be designed to have more penetrative power. But the blood also makes little sense in terms of where the soldier was hit to begin with. Nor why half his glove has seemingly exploded off.",1555304415,1,1555300815.0

10,Dohi64,"**[one clue crossword (android):](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appynation.occw)** continuing from previous months. finally finished all 46 chapters, which opened up the recently added mix up mode. instead of single letters to make words in a crossword, you have 2 and 3-letter chunks and have to create up to 9 words from them, still based on a single picture, but not arranged like a crossword, and the chunks aren't alphabetical either, which I think would make it more pleasant. did the first few but not gonna bother with the other 200+, it's not that great, so that's it for a while on the mobile front.

**[cubicity: slide puzzle:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/970580/)** continuing from last week. teleports are a bit annoying right now, as only some of them are marked, and on most levels you have to try each to find out where they lead. the developer said they'd fix this, along with windowed mode and some other stuff, but there hasn't been a patch for weeks, which isn't great. I'm about 2/3 done with the 95 levels and figured out a few more earlier 3-star solutions, including level 7, which was bothering me for weeks. plenty left to perfect though.

**[one finger death punch 2:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/980300/)** continuing from last week. brawlers are still fucking shit, my favorite light sword round is still fucked up (partly by brawlers, partly by other weapons, no classic light sword round anymore, despite what the devs said when I asked), and my other least favorite thing is the blade storm round, where you have to fight weapons, neatly labeled, but who the fuck has the time to read, because they're all white, unlike on other levels. and while the rest of the game can be very generous with missing, here it's miss after fucking miss for me because oops, that weapon happened to get rid of the entire left side, so my next attack missed, and miss equals getting hit in this round. very frustrating, though looking at the labels seems to do the trick, as long as I can process dodge, block and other words fast enough and react appropriately, so it's not the worst thing ever.

I managed 5 stars on the entirety of the first 8 maps (only because 4 stars is 5+ misses), except the pixel bonus round with 920 enemies, which I don't think I'll ever be able to finish at all, my best is around 290 left. the last stage here has 600+ enemies, it's only on 4 stars, but I only missed 1 extra time on my first try, very frustrating. tried a couple more times but it takes fucking forever, so I'll leave it at that. there's manual speed adjusting, haven't tried it, if I do badly it goes down anyway and doesn't go above 1.0 too often in my case. at 1.6 it's fast as fuck already and it can go up to 3x, I think, plus there's a hidden red button that can speed things up even further. good on you if you can handle it, but it would be the opposite of fun for me, and also impossible.

there are a couple new enemy types, one changes its colors, kinda like a mini boss, and the other might be an enigma, don't think you can tell what the attack pattern is. a few new rounds got introduced as well, they're tough, like the one with 50% shorter range, my least favorite along with the sawblade. and there's a 9th map, apparently, with more of this new stuff, and a few levels I can't possibly complete: the other bonus stage with 1k enemies (245 left is my best), and a shorter range round with 3 hp, can't even use a revenge token on these, so I'm missing 1 skill point, and everything else is at 5 stars, save for the final level (4 stars, 6 misses after a couple tries) and what I mentioned above. and of course I had to watch the ending video on youtube because they still haven't fixed playback on win7.

after that there are 35 'plinko' bonus levels with some more new enemy and even round types. it's blind, no attack range or attack patterns, just colors, which can be tricky, but surprisingly didn't bother me at all. levels are random, so when I got a short range one or one with 1050 enemies and inevitably died, I went back to the 'map' and got a different type. [total blindness](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1723312279) was the only new round I ran into, I was dead in a second, just managed to comprehend the 'skills locked' message and boom. did I mention you only have one health? kept trying and managed to kill all 30 enemies eventually, on heroic 1x speed by then. wasn't that bad, but glad it wasn't featured earlier, though next time 35 enemies went down on the first try. and once I got a level with 1400(!) enemies, tried it and WON! 18 misses, but still, not too shabby. then I wanted to watch this ending cutscene on youtube as well, but it's not there.

normally I don't do random or endless stuff, but after about 12 hours I wanted to play some more, so tried survival mode. your tier doesn't reset when you die, so you can stop anytime, which is convenient, but speed resets then, so welcome to tedium city every time, it's too slow even for me and there's no manual speed here. but unlike the first game, it's only a matter of time until blind survival unlocks at tier 10. it takes fucking forever though, and while it's more of the same gameplay, I didn't like this drawn-out, grindy version of slaying thousands of enemies slowly for the most part and was ready to quit at tier 5, but figured I might as well reach 10 and never touch it again. except for 10 tiers of blind survival, that's also done now, with my first run netting [5318 kills](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1724794402).

tried no luca no next, where a fucking cat's in the way. didn't unlock it in the first game, had to have killed 1k enemies in blind survival in one go, which I didn't bother with, and wasn't amused by this version either, though you can get rid of the fucking thing by moving the mouse. if you reach tier 10, it unlocks baby survival. didn't bother, and I think it was a bad idea to lock every new game mode behind 10 tiers of tedium instead of 5. not that I'd have played 5 tiers of this cat shit anyway. wanted to check out what baby's like, there were no videos on youtube, but after asking on the forum, somebody was kind enough to upload some footage. it's luca blind with a different picture obscuring the view.

then I tried gauntlet, which isn't endless, as it turns out. have to make your way to the end by completing about 30 levels in a row by choosing whichever looks best from the ones available. the catch is, you don't get full health for every round, which happens even in multi rounds, so 10 hp plus whatever you can get back randomly for the whole thing, and if you die, you have to start over. I managed to do it on the first try and the cutscene played normally for some reason, then there's a blind version, also completed it on the first try, but the video didn't play properly this time and it isn't on youtube either.

finally, I looked up the easter eggs and other hidden stuff (not gonna spoil how to access them), managed to complete the hidden credits bonus round with 2.2k enemies on the first try, fuck yeah! it went up to 1.75 speed, wouldn't have tried a second time, of course, and the other one on the contact screen was a bust pretty fast, literally, as the speed got up to 2.3 and I only took down 1k enemies, 1.3k left. and that's that, played more than 20 hours, about twice as much as the first game (only completed the map on easy there, save for 2 nigh-impossible levels, and tried two types of survival once), though I'm sure they'll add more things down the road, so I'll be back.

it's a lot of fun, but there are some really stupid design decisions, which would be fine in a first game, not in a sequel, just to fuck everything up. also, no patch notes outside the game, not as announcements, not on the forum, they can't be fucked to post them, and there are several patches a day sometimes and they're not even mentioning everything in the game. at least some of the issues are fixed now, but don't think they'll change brawlers or fix video playback. and I couldn't disagree more with the devs, who said the sequel is an improvement in every possible way, basically rendering the first game obsolete. fuck no, both are worth playing because they have good stuff (and bad) the other lacks.

**[avalon legends solitiare 3:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/841980/)** felt like another solitaire. the first was okay, the second was pretty great, I found it one of the best on steam, and this one looks promising too. while there's 'only' 250 levels instead of 300 and no voiceover in the intro, you're still rebuilding a settlement, but you can hire heroes to help if you have a tavern, they seem like extra power-ups, not sure if the cost is forever or per level yet. there's even some lore (under 'more', then 'extras' in the main menu, weirdly) and a hidden minigame somewhere, plus card types not commonly found in similar games. like it so far, except it's very quiet, there's only 4 ambient tracks and they don't even play in town or on the map, while the previous game had pleasant tunes, though I listen to my own music in games like this after a while anyway. oh, and the level finish animation is way too long and slow.

Consider why a skilled player is even capable of stomping a new player; they have better reaction times, better knowledge of appropriate items, accrue more gold, and as a result put out a ton more damage.

You can add a mechanic wherein players do reduced damage when their team isn't nearby. This restricts a pro's ability to roam the map destroying people on their own.

You can add a team ability that allows players to pool gold once a game to target a player and cripple their stats. This would further limit the smurfs ability to stomp.

These are just off the top of my head and as I mentioned already, they're terrible ideas because the current game design would suffer if they were added.

The complete cancellation of a game hasn't yet happened to me personally, but some of the games (as a service) that I play or have played have been downsized, e.g. Heroes of the Storm. Even hearing such news have bothered and/or hurt me and I can only empathise with people who've been told that a game they've been playing for months or years, that they've perhaps invested serious money into, will be shut down and they can't play it ever again.

Now, if a character is performing too good, they may be nerfed or reworked, at which point the player no longer has the same character that they paid for.  


Then with games like World of Warcraft, even if you would have been happy just playing some specific expansion, new expansions are pushed out and your gameplay experience will be irrevocably changed whether you buy the expansion or not.

9,psyRhen,"While the Anvil engine is very obviously dated, a lot of the issues you have with bringing siege over to the next gen of consoles are kinda moot since Siege actually had to remove assets or destruction from certain parts of the game not because of hardware limitations but because of game/map balancing.

Your issue with fully destructible furniture for instance: in Kafé, there were cabinets that you could punch the doors off of and prone into to hide in and it was near impossible to see anyone hiding in. The bigger issue was that you couldn't predict which cabinet they're hiding in because the cabinets were in at least 3 other locations. They've now made it so you can no longer crawl into the cabinets. 

While new hardware will certainly be able to handle more on screen at once, I think that having more paintings on walls and silverware, plates, glasses, etc. actually placed on tables would not only be distracting for a competitive shooter like Siege, but it would take up GPU Processing power that could otherwise be used elsewhere like loading the game faster or having higher FPS to take advantage of TVs that have 120Hz refresh rate. Or hell if/when Siege releases for the new generation, it could have full M/KB support to have X-platform play. 

I see more advantages to continue playing the current release of siege on the next generation of consoles than to pour millions of dollars into writing a new engine ( something they're probably already working on anyway), transferring and training Devs from Siege to the new R6S project on the new engine, and start over from scratch.

CSGO, LoL, OW, Dota, Rocket League, and many others have a very steady and loyal playerbase BECAUSE they don't have sequels.

Ubisoft has also already invested a ton into Proleague. If you take devs away from Siege, proleague will basically die and your playerbase will fall off because the game isn't getting the support it needs to keep players wanting to come back (see: Heroes of the Storm).

I think that just because a new console generation is coming out that we need to ditch the games we currently love and are highly invested in so we can get that sweet ""next gen experience"" is a total fallacy.

I remember when I couldn't play BF4 with my friends on my 360 anymore because they switched over to the Xbox One. Back then it made sense because the hardware was leagues different. But that's not the case now. Everything is cloud based and the accounts are pretty much the same between platforms. Theres no reason for a siege 2 to exist *yet.*",1559633267,8,1559629667.0

I guess from a business standpoint, I can see why they aren't just going to implement an IP region block on the shops for a gacha game, and effectively maintain a lite, free-to-play version of the game where they won't be seeing monetary returns on.

13,F8L-Fool,"&gt;  I know the Starcraft FPS would have technically been based off of an existing franchise, but it would have been a dramatic shift for Blizzard entertainment to be competing alongside the Battlefield's and CoD's. I guess Blizzard felt that they weren't ready to make that shift.

That is what people said when Overwatch was announced. 

Honestly, I don't think there's a single genre that Blizzard isn't prepared to tackle at this point. WoW seemed like a huge leap and a gamble when they were basically a RTS/ARPG studio. Hearthstone, and to a lesser extent Heroes of the Storm, were looked at as cash grabs until they blew up.

If Blizzard decides to release a game in a new genre, be it new IP or otherwise, it's because they are confident the game can not just compete with the market, but excel. History so far has proven that to be very true.

What makes me sad is that Blizzard refuses to release games that compete with *themselves* in a genre. They stopped making Warcraft RTS and focused on Starcraft instead. They won't make a MMO out of the other franchises and most likely won't make an ARPG either.

I'd *love* a Diablo MMO and a Starcraft ARPG. Unfortunately they don't want to fracture their own market share so they keep things very segmented. I suspect part of the Starcraft FPS is along that same vein, in regards to the fact they have a FPS franchise in Overwatch.",1559856182,2,1559852582.0

20,OwnRound,"&gt; They used to be the golden developer who could do no wrong.

Blizzard was awesome but I think Blizzard fans have some rose-tinted glasses about the past.

Starcraft Ghost was a shit show, RealID was a horrifying preview of privacy issues we're still navigating and it seems like Blizzard has this habit of consistently touching esports in their games and breaking it or not letting it be as big as it could be if they weren't so involved.  

StarCraft was fantastic when it was managed by the community and Blizzards involvement was minimal.  Same with Warcraft 3.  They were huge esports games. 

Blizzard tried pushing an esports angle midway through World of Warcraft(the ad's on websites like GotFrag were inescapable) which, to few peoples surprise, ate shit.  StarCraft 2 had a really great start but it *never* lived up to the fervor of its original.  Heroes of the Storm was a huge failure.  And while Overwatch is awesome, I think it could be so much more if it weren't restricted to being only what Blizzard allows it to be.  In the words of the fighting game community, Overwatch is too ""esports"".  

The scene is so controlled and neutered that it barely has its own personality.  Not to mention their mentality of franchising brings in all the issues that conventional sports have that we *could* escape in esports, but that's a conversation for another day.  But I look at something like Counter-Strike and Street Fighter and Tekken and all these games that have developer support but are primarily driven by the community, and it bums me out that Overwatch isn't permitted to do the same.  Overwatch has all the fixings of being a timeless game that the community can sustain and make into something much bigger but Blizzard controls the discourse way too much and needs to let the community ""own"" how the game operates more.  

I think something really awesome that Valve does is they support tournament organizers.  They've pushed money into promising tournaments and then were really hands-off in how the tournament is handled, save a few elements or if their intervention *seemed* necssary, and otherwise let the third-party tournaments handle everything and its been fantastic.  Now we have all these different tournaments, ESL, Dreamhack, FACEIT, PGL, ELEAGUE, IEM that practically compete with each other.  And the reason they gained popularity is because Valve advertised them as ""Valve Majors"" and now the entire scene pays attention everytime these tournament organizers throw a big tournament.",1559775686,0,1559772086.0

&gt; I want to see a quite bit more evidence than a single expansion for an mmo and some hearthstone expansions before declaring their death.

How long have you been following Blizzard?

They're ""death"" (or, more accurately, the death of Blizzard as we knew it to be) has been signaled for a long time.

Starcraft II released *nine* years ago. It's a game that has some of the worst writing I have **ever** seen in a AAA game. Lots of questionable design choices. Content felt extremely weak. The other two installments were somehow even worse. Although seeing as how Starcraft 1 was initially pretty bad but redeemed by the two expansions which were mostly made by **two other companies** makes this possibly expected as an outcome.

Diablo III hit release in 2012, seven years ago. Auction House compromised the little bit of content the game had. Again, story was poorly written and lazy. Poorly thought out mechanics. Two years later we got Reaper of Souls which brought a lot of much needed change, but even that was a quick band-aid on a festering wound. It's currently in a very solid ""meh"" state, but other than *mostly* some minor number adjustments in patches, the franchise hasn't seen anything good in many years (which is expected to change soon^^tm but we'll have to see what that project is like).

It is also important to note that Diablo III's Auction House revealed that Blizzard was more interested in monitization of a franchise over function (although some aspects in SC2 were strong hints). This trends continues to this day.

Hearthstone in 2014 made it clear they (the company) cared mostly for selling you card packs, balance and fun be damned. Still a popular game, though, so I suppose overall it was a great business choice.

Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about World of Warcraft. While the expansions have been sorta hit-or-miss to begin with, it wasn't until about 2012/2014 where the expansions and content/balance updates were just generally questionable. While a good argument can be made that a big reason the game started to drop in popularity would be due to fatigue, I think a large amount of it had to do with quality of product too.

2015 brought us Heroes of the Storm, which IMO is one of the most unfortunate projects modern Blizzard has done. Unfortunate in the sense that it had great potential that was vastly underutilized. Fun concept, plenty of franchises to pull from, lots of lore to explore, etc. Ruined by a terrible, terrible matchmaking system that was never fixed. Blizzard's desperate ""notice me senpai"" when it came to eSports seemed to focus too many resources that way and not enough into improving the game.

Enter Overwatch, 2016's hit. Arguably the best product that modern Blizzard has released, it still receives regular content updates... although most of it utilizing MTX. And the overall direction of the game quality suffering due to Blizzard's continued obsession over eSports.

My last entry in this timeline will be about Diablo Immortal. Not about the game itself, as we haven't really had a chance to play it and it very well could be good (even as a mobile title). Rather, it's on this timeline due to Blizzon 2018. Blizzard's handling of the Diablo franchise here confirms that they're completely out of touch with their audience. Hyping up the Diablo franchise then having their keynote presentation be a *mobile* game announcement to their vastly PC-centric audience? Stupid.

*****

I know that's a *lot* of words, so **tl;dr** Blizzard's decaying quality in products has been a nearly decade long occurrence. Seeing as how their leading talent has been bleeding from the company for at least the same amount of time makes me think we'll never have old Blizzard. For all intents and purposes, they're ""dead"" to me.",1559436745,-1,1559433145.0

I think last year they realized they shouldn't force ESports so hard and let it come a bit more organically. They trimmed off many, many ESports employees and I believe they even hired more game designers. I fully expect the company to bounce back to making great games with announcements at this years and next years Blizzcon.

I guess from a business standpoint, I can see why they aren't just going to implement an IP region block on the shops for a gacha game, and effectively maintain a lite, free-to-play version of the game where they won't be seeing monetary returns on.

0,SmokeyHooves,"Heroes of the storm is still the best MOBA to me. I know people like to call it shallow and easy, but in reality to me it takes out the clunky mechanics that most moba’s have to make a combat focus fast paced game. No turn around speed, no grinding gold and levels, everything happens just because you’re playing the game correctly. So the main focus comes to team fights, positioning and builds set to help you win. I love the objectives in the game being the main focus of each map. It throws a wrench into the whole lane for 20 minutes.

I get that some people like the slow build up of other MOBA’s but I think the payoff is more fun then the build up.",1561898863,309,1561895263.0
1,WumFan64,"SIDE RANT:

That subject always really frustrates me. I **fully believe** that Blizzard was adamant about being able to play duplicate heroes because **they intended to sell champs LoL/HotS style**.

FACTS:

* The Blizzcon prior to release, Blizzard REFUSED to talk monetization. The community was outraged, fearing the worst

* Blizzard heavily advertised that you could play any hero at any time, then almost immediately backtracked on that when ranked was released

* Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard's MOBA, was not doing well

LOGIC:

* Why would Blizzard not talk about monetization so close to release? Because they didn't know, it was undecided 

* Why would being able to play any hero at any time be important? **What if you didn't own enough heroes**, and became locked out at the pick screen? What if you bought a hero and couldn't even play them the next match?

* Blizzard flipped on duplicate heroes due to imbalance. How could premier game developers not see something basic like 3 Winston's being broken on KotH? They knew, but their previous monetization model wouldn't allow them to fix the issue (see point above)

* HotS failed. This is largely because Dota set the new standard for MOBA. When HotS tried to implement a rune page-like system, players immediately bailed and said ""If I have to deal with that again, I'll just go back to League"". HotS failure, due to competition from Dota, is what saved Overwatch from the same model of monetization.

EPIC STYLE:

* TotalBiscuit, months before he died, confirmed all of this from his inside sources at Blizzard

It's a non-issue, but I get so frustrated when people tell me Overwatch was never going to sell champs. They literally almost did. The whole game was set up to do this.  Anyone can see this if they just look at the facts and use a little bit of logic... epic style.",1561762763,130,1561759163.0

There was this arrogance about that announcement video that made me want HOTS to fail.

If Blizzard came out and said this is our take on the MOBA genre, by scaling back certain things, and so on and so forth, I would have been more receptive. I still gave the game a shot, but my mindset going in wasn't favourable.",1560189878,40,1560186278.0

4,__Hello_my_name_is__,"&gt; feels like a lot of money went down the drain that could have gone into game development.

That's not really how that works, though. It's not like they had a budget and went ""How much of this will go to esports instead of development?"". For better or worse, the higher ups at Blizzard decided that esports will be a big part of Overwatch, and they spent a *tremendous* amount of money on it (and still do).

But at the same time, the Overwatch team is also the best supported of the dev teams out there at Blizzard. Hearthstone, Starcraft and Heroes of the Storm players would *love* to get even half as many content and QoL updates as Overwatch gets these days. And that sure as hell has to do with Blizzard's esports strategy.

So if Blizzard were to cut the esports budget, they sure as hell would also cut the developer budget of the game by just as much. And if they had never invested that much to begin with, the devs most likely would not have gotten as much support, either.",1561458257,18,1561454657.0

10,adamleng,"The reason Heroes of the Storm failed is because it is an excellent example of video games being created by committees of corporate jackoffs chasing trends rather than creative people coming up with an idea for what would be a good game - and ruining what should have been a license to print cash as an IP, to boot.

You can't beat Dota and League by doing the exact same thing they're doing, apparently these business majors never studied the early adopter advantage in school. And you definitely can't make a good game by forcing it to be an esport, an expensive lesson Blizzard needs to learn over and over again with how many games they've ruined by doing so at this point.

Heroes should never have been some forced 5v5 3-lane hyper-competitive bullshit, that avenue of gameplay has been locked down and with Blizzard's infamous at this point balancing there was no way in hell it was ever going to edge out Dota or League in that department. At best that should have been some side-mode like aram for League. Instead, the game should have been a combination of [Gauntlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(1985_video_game)) and Mario Party.

Heroes should have been a batshit insane massively multiplayer party game with RPG elements. An MMO-lite, if you will. You pick a hero and go into game modes with upwards of 8-12 other players and go around killing megabosses from those three universes, doing PvP minigames in a competitive ladder-like format (like Auto Chess), and doing crazy PvE quests that they never could have pulled off in WoW. Imagine Raynor and the Necromancer from D2 fighting against Blackwing alongside like 10 other people playing other heroes, tower defense levels where you kill creeps with your hero and then use the gold to buy items for them Warcraft 3 style, and other Mario Party-esque shenanigans they could have pulled off.

The beauty is the game could have been monetized so much better in this format as well. Do a Diablo 3-style transmog system for every hero with tons of slots for cosmetic gear: armor, weapon, mount, pet, banner, etc. You gain XP by playing your favorite hero and by leveling up the hero doesn't gain new abilities or anything, but rather new slots for customization. Introduce the mobile market into the equation too by having like a WoW garrison-type system where you install the app on your phone and can send heroes out to do timed quests for gold that you use to buy decorations for your hideout where your party hangs out while waiting for game queues to pop.

Shit is so simple a fucking child could come up with even more and better ideas, but I wouldn't expect that level of creativity and brilliance from the company that masterminded that Diablo Immortal fiasco.",1561911444,10,1561907844.0
11,gorgewall,"HoN was the officially-blessed successor of DotA. They'd worked with Icefrog on it, and all characters to that point were model and name swaps of DotA heroes. There was never any indication that there would *be* a DotA 2 until Valve swooped in, grabbed Icefrog, got to work on their own, and then HoN had to start making completely new characters. 


HoN wasn't killed by its price alone. It was arguably a far better way of going about things than League, which was charging far more by that point if you wanted to get all of the characters without huge time investment. What killed HoN was that it was no longer ""official"" DotA 2, and anyone who wanted to get into the HoN experience could just play DOTA2 for free--since most everything in HoN up to that point *was* DotA, same as DOTA2. It had no chance to compete with a game that was essentially *itself* but free. Had DOTA2 been something entirely different--another MOBA, another brand, different systems--then I'm sure HoN could have kept chugging along with its up-front price.

17,_Valisk,"&gt; In always thought traditional moba mechanics were very clunky. I never enjoyed dota or lol because I always felt a few things were off

Yeah, a lot of League of Legends players say that too but, for Dota players, it's familiar and anything else feels unnatural. I never played the mod, and I probably wouldn't have been able to given how janky it is, so I totally get it. 

&gt; It’s like if you were playing call of duty and you had to spend 10 minutes cleaning your gun. 

I get the point you're trying to make but boy, that's a little hyperbolic, lol. There's lots to do in the laning phase, it's not all carries right clicking creeps. 

&gt; I think making characters control worse is awful. Red dead and GTA make me a little upset because the characters are unresponsive and I feel that way with a lot of characters

That's a result of turn rates. I know League of Legends doesn't have turn rates and your original post claims that Heroes of the Storm doesn't either so yeah, that's probably it. Personally, I don't like the removal of turn rates because I don't think it feels good when an enemy instantly turns to face you. 

&gt; I love the different objectives and the uniqueness of each hero and how that totally changes the game plan with your team 

In Dota 2? Totally agreed. The homogenization of heroes in League of Legends is one of the things I can't stand about it. I haven't played enough of Heroes of the Storm to have an opinion, but that one guy that two players control is a pretty cool concept. 

&gt; no dota or league player will deny the overly toxic community that plagues their community

In my experience, this entirely depends on your behavior score. I have the maximum score attainable and I very rarely run into awful, game-ruining people. 

&gt; while Dota has some characters that I like a lot of them feel like generic fantasy characters (I mean some are literally just reskinned Warcraft characters) 

I feel like a lot of non-Dota players say this but, I dunno, I never really saw it that way. Granted, I was never a Warcraft player, but I think the aesthetic of Dota 2 is pretty varied and unique. Like, yeah, they *have* some tropes like the dark elf ranger and the flame mage, but they've also got the embodiment of the universe, the creator of the world, a humanoid ancient.

I only play SP games now because these GaaS games are just not my thing, i dont want recurring minor doses of content, i want to play the game, maybe get some DLC and then i want it to be done.

AC Odyssey is great so far, even though its not completely GaaS the horrendously long level Grind to unlock all skills is ridiculous, but the gameplay makes up for it and isnt nearly as bad as The Division or Destiny 2 etc.",1561443213,2,1561439613.0

26,dexo568,"So I don’t know if you know about the whole Heroes of the Storm developer cut drama, but tldr Blizzard’s MOBA team got substantially downsized. 

What’s really interesting about it is that the remaining devs frequently post extremely candid AMAs about features and development priorities, and it’s made me really think about how much of modern game dev is needless polish. For example, the most recent Hero, Anduin, doesn’t properly animate his lips when speaking. Someone asked about it and they said that not only was it not worth their time to fix, but they wouldn’t do it on any hero going forward. Its a top down MOBA, who cares about lip sync?

It’s just super interesting how they’re being forced to strip off a lot of needless polish layers to keep making a fun game on a tight budget.",1561588182,2,1561584582.0
27,Endyo,"I have no idea how much time I put into Heroes of the Storm.  Certainly more than the 600 hours I put into Dota 2 though given how long I played.  I definitely had more fun overall with the more relaxed experience, but looking back I just can't think of too many specific moments.  So many lopsided Quickmatch experiences... so many times new heroes got introduced and were massively overpowered until the next patch - seemingly just to drive sales.  Sometimes maps I just hated to play showing up over and over because they were in the cycle.  It was a great game peppered with bad choices.  If it launched with all heroes available, maybe it would have alleviated some of the bigger problems.  It doesn't matter at this point though...",1561968683,1,1561965083.0
28,BenjaminTalam,I actually played heroes of the storm exclusively because it was so casual and accessible but I stopped when it started being more like other mobas. Starting with towers having unlimited ammo.,1561313165,1,1561309565.0
29,Antidote4Life,Why would you want blizzard to try and copy another genre? They already proved with heroes of the storm that they aren't great at it. Just play the the valve version and be happy.,1560706538,1,1560702938.0
30,VoidInsanity,"&gt; having multiple maps is by no means a necessity in a moba game.

Neither is it for any other game by that logic. 

&gt; in fact, having several maps can become a balancing nightmare

No it isn't, see nearly every other game in existence and if you need a ""moba"" example see Heroes of the Storm. There is a drastic difference between something being a ""Balancing nightmare"" and incompetent design or developers.

&gt; and even if it doesn't, it still complicates game balance

If done wrong. Maps are a static entity and effect everything equally if done correctly. The game isn't going to devolve into an unplayable mess because one map has more trees than another for example.

&gt; especially considering that dota 2 didn't start from the ground up, but instead built on top of the already laid groundwork from the years of development on wc3 dota, why would valve even think about a second map

Because one map is a limitation of the Warcraft mod scene that valve doesn't have to abide by? Have you been paying attention at all?",1560734264,1,1560730664.0
31,Dracious,"I have played DOTA 2 for god knows how many years now, and dabbled in DOTA on Warcraft 3 and other RTS games in general, so it is like a perfect storm for me to understand the mechanics as second nature, I am not particular good at it or anything, but the complex stuff about it has always been in my ballpark.

And despite all that I still love HotS, mechanically it is a great game that has done a good job at cutting the fat and complexity of DOTA while still keeping the core feeling of the game intact. I still prefer DOTA 2, but I can definitely see why someone would play HotS more and for a couple of years I did despite me being fully fluent in DOTA 2's mechanics. HotS is like 70% as competitive as DOTA2 but with 10% of the learning curve, which is a great achievement (I pulled those numbers out my ass but you get the idea). 

Add on the fact that most people never played DOTA style games before and have limited time to learn, HotS had a great niche for a lot of gamers, especially once you add on the Blizzard characters etc",1561986200,1,1561982600.0
32,Ferromagneticfluid,"Pretty much. I think there is a fun game there. 

I played a bunch of League, could never get into Dota really, but my time played on Heroes of the Storm was just so much more enjoyable. The fact the matches were designed to end at about 20 minutes, the fact that all the objectives that pop up are constantly pushing the winning team to win sooner really helps for the health of the game.

Plus I always thought they captured how it feels to play heroes in the game. When I play as Valla, I felt like I was playing the Demon Hunter from D3. When I played as Tassadar, I felt like I was playing a High Templar. Very clear design decisions on how these champs should feel to play.

Contrast that to League, and sometimes I feel like Riot has no idea what exactly they want a champion to be. They have released kits in the last few years only to have like 4 actual mechanics removed from the kit for balancing purposes.",1561927108,1,1561923508.0
33,_Valisk,"I was like, *three*-years deep into Dota before Heroes of the Storm came out, so maybe I'm not the best source of opinion, but I've always thought that all of the things you list as positives just... take away from the game. 

It doesn't help that I've never been much of a Blizzard fan so I don't have the same nostalgia connection that so many people do.",1561946187,1,1561942587.0
34,stationhollow,"Every hero and player sharing the same power curve is what does it. One of my favourite things about Dota is how much the picks determine the game. Different heroes scale at different points in the game. Each gets power spikes at certain levels and/or items that allow you to combine these with other heroes to make a perfect storm of sorts that has to clash with the opponent's strategy.

When all these are always a flat linear line that you share with the enemy then it removes a large part of the dynamic nature of the match.",1561961130,1,1561957530.0
35,Ode1st,"Especially because Blizzard never ""invents"" a genre. Their whole thing is getting into a genre early and polishing their take on it to the extreme.

* Warcraft was inspired by Dune II
* Diablo was probably the most ""original"" game Blizzard made, but even then, loads of loot-based dungeon crawlers already existed by then
* Overwatch was obviously just Blizzard cashing in on TF2 many years late
* Hearthstone was Blizzard cashing in on the extremely prolific-at-the-time CCG mobile game scene
* Heroes of the Storm was obviously late to the MOBA scene
* World of Warcraft defined its genre, but it wasn't even the first *popular* MMO, much less close to the first MMO chronologically
* Lost Vikings was a puzzle platformer, of which there were many, but had the innovation of swapping characters at least. Also, easily Blizzard's best writing. Their writing never got this good again. I never looked into why -- like if the writer left or something",1560207488,1,1560203888.0
36,HilariousScreenname,"You sound exactly like me. I was the exact same way with Heroes of the Storm. I've since gotten therepy, gotten some meds, and I'm in a much better place now. I have interests in other things, I feel less anxiety about going out, I dont use video games as a distraction to my depression.

If you have the means, I would try to go see a therapist. I stubbornly avoided it for years, thinking I didnt need it, and that I could overcome my addiction on my own. I thought it was all a mental game that I had to overcome. Which it is, but to have someone to talk to and help you find the roots of your problem, it's an amazing thing. 

So yeah. You're not alone, man.",1560373453,1,1560369853.0
37,dexo568,"Heroes of the Storm switched to this model. Loot Boxes are bought with in-game currency, but you can buy a specific item in the loot box pool with premium currency or an in-game currency you get when you receive a duplicate in a lootbox. 

It's super generous, and IMO is an example of lootboxes done right...

Might be too-consumer friendly, considering it makes so little money the dev team got downsized.",1562694927,1,1562691327.0
38,mrducky78,"The now ded gaem Heroes of the Storm did away with last hitting and the laning stage just isnt up to the same level as Dota/LoL. There is some extreme depth in managing the laning stage that extends right up to the professionals. There are pros who dont feel comfortable going mid against certain players who are just mechanically superior to them, option to send someone else there to sack that lane as a loss while they take the more comfortable safe lane.

For example. You time it so your creep AND their creep are getting low and the last hits will be roughly the same time. You can now go for the deny, push slightly early to fuck up their last hit without getting the deny on the slight chance you can get your last hit while preventing them theirs. Harass them as they go for the last hit and secure your last hit with alternate means such as a spell, or just go for the last hit.  Even in the lead up to that situation, you can put more attacks into shunting the lane quicker to make a play for rune, you can put more attacks into denies to draw the lane back to set up for a gank or to just play more defensive or to harass. 

They are low and their regen hasnt yet arrive on courier. Now perhaps that harass is more meaningful since it puts them absurdly low and can effectively give you a free and uncontested lane as they await regen to arrive.

Its thousands and thousands of decisions compounding on each other to success or failure or commonly enough, both at the same time. Its enough to easily demarcate between professionals of the game. And its all predicating on who hits that guy last.",1560783011,1,1560779411.0
39,Clbull,"Heroes of the Storm died because Blizzard upheld lengthy silence penalties over petty sarcastic remarks. [This is a screenshot I took of a (deleted) forum thread](https://i.imgur.com/GTerOhq.png) where someone got his 256 day silence upheld over some of the lamest E rated chat ever. [I also verified with this guy that it was that long.](https://i.imgur.com/Vkxsnme.png)

To explain how and why the silence was this long, Blizzard introduced a new silence penalty in 2015. The first silence is 24 hours while subsequent silences are doubled in duration. It takes just 10 silences to be penalized for a year and a half (512 days.) Streamers like Asmongold, Grubby and Chu8 quickly exposed the system as being an automated one where reports are not investigated at all by customer support. This has led to players abusing the report system to get others unfairly banned. Blizzard also changed Heroes of the Storm in 2016 to ban silenced players from queuing for Ranked matches, adding actual weight to chat bans.

The worst part is that Blizzard worked to actually censor players complaining about the system, first by deleting any forum threads complaining about their overly excessive abusive chat policy, then by ignoring every question raising concerns about the game's broken report system in [a (relevant) AMA last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8bzsup/ama_with_heroes_developers_april_13_2018/), and finally by getting the HotS subreddit mods to remove any posts about the report system. Based on how much outrage there was about it, is it no surprise that enough players left to justify Blizzard killing HGC and relegating HotS to a skeleton crew of developers?

40,palebee,"I used to play Heroes of the Storm (very team-play heavy), and when I was playing poorly, and my teammates called me out for playing poorly and decided to make me the scapegoat for losing the match, that hurt me a little bit because I knew they had a point.
  
But when people just yell out curses or slurs with absolutely no context, who cares? These people know absolutely nothing about me, about my skin color, sexuality, age or what music I listen to. They're kindergarten bullies, they're just probing to see from whom they can get a reaction from, and then focus their trolling efforts on those. Easiest thing in the world to ignore.

42,Warskull,"No, it was definitely too late.  League came out in 2009, DotA 2 was available to everyone in 2011, Heroes of the Storm came out in 2015.

The whole genre was already in decline by them.  Blizzard missed the huge wave of games.  The hero shooter genre was already emerging.  Rainbow Six Siege came at the end of 2015, Overwatch in 2016, and games that failed to survive about the same time.

HotS had superior mechanics and design to both DotA2 and LoL, but was never given top billing by Blizzard.  They never had the time and resources to properly develop the game.  The game was clearly treated as a B-team side project.

A pity because it was the only game in the genre that seemed willing to tackle the problems that existed and grow beyond the Warcraft 3 version of DotA.",1561915336,-2,1561911736.0

44,battleturtle0526,"At this point it almost feels like it would be demeaning to the developers to call them 'Blizzard'. There are some developers out there really driven and really passionate about the game for sure, but Blizzard's passion seemes to have moved nearly completely to profiting. And by Blizzard I mean the decision makers --activision--.

I mean its not just the diablo thing its also about the lack of work on Wow despite its popularity amongst the loyal enthusiasts, and the heroes of the storm esports cancelation. Blizzard is fucking over its dedicated customers left and right.",1561054536,-3,1561050936.0
45,VexonCross,"There's a player base, but the developers have been leaning hard into casual play over the last 2 years or so. They fired everyone in the esports division days before last Christmas without warning, so the top players are all gone, both pro players and people who might've wanted to become pro players. 

What's left is a ranked mode with bad match making and a questionable MMR system. Quick Match is a complete shit show and balance patches are either shuffling paperwork to make it look like they're doing something, or they're completely tanking a hero that needs a little nerf, or making an unplayed hero priority on everyone's ban list with a gigantic buff.

Heroes of the Storm once had the framework to be the best game in the moba genre from a game design standpoint, but there's a skeleton crew operating it right now. They had new hero releases every 2/3 weeks for a long time. So far this year they released 2. It's basically just waiting to be taken out and shot.",1561902090,-5,1561898490.0
46,SmokeyHooves,"Heroes of the storm is still the best MOBA to me. I know people like to call it shallow and easy, but in reality to me it takes out the clunky mechanics that most moba’s have to make a combat focus fast paced game. No turn around speed, no grinding gold and levels, everything happens just because you’re playing the game correctly. So the main focus comes to team fights, positioning and builds set to help you win. I love the objectives in the game being the main focus of each map. It throws a wrench into the whole lane for 20 minutes.

I get that some people like the slow build up of other MOBA’s but I think the payoff is more fun then the build up.",1561898863,309,1561895263.0
47,WumFan64,"SIDE RANT:

That subject always really frustrates me. I **fully believe** that Blizzard was adamant about being able to play duplicate heroes because **they intended to sell champs LoL/HotS style**.

FACTS:

* The Blizzcon prior to release, Blizzard REFUSED to talk monetization. The community was outraged, fearing the worst

* Blizzard heavily advertised that you could play any hero at any time, then almost immediately backtracked on that when ranked was released

* Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard's MOBA, was not doing well

LOGIC:

* Why would Blizzard not talk about monetization so close to release? Because they didn't know, it was undecided 

* Why would being able to play any hero at any time be important? **What if you didn't own enough heroes**, and became locked out at the pick screen? What if you bought a hero and couldn't even play them the next match?

* Blizzard flipped on duplicate heroes due to imbalance. How could premier game developers not see something basic like 3 Winston's being broken on KotH? They knew, but their previous monetization model wouldn't allow them to fix the issue (see point above)

* HotS failed. This is largely because Dota set the new standard for MOBA. When HotS tried to implement a rune page-like system, players immediately bailed and said ""If I have to deal with that again, I'll just go back to League"". HotS failure, due to competition from Dota, is what saved Overwatch from the same model of monetization.

EPIC STYLE:

* TotalBiscuit, months before he died, confirmed all of this from his inside sources at Blizzard

It's a non-issue, but I get so frustrated when people tell me Overwatch was never going to sell champs. They literally almost did. The whole game was set up to do this.  Anyone can see this if they just look at the facts and use a little bit of logic... epic style.",1561762763,130,1561759163.0
48,Scoob79,"When Blizzard announced Heroes of the storm, the one thing that made me not want to like it was them trying to say it was in the ""hero brawler genre."" In that whole video, they seemed to try so hard to be seperate from DOTA, LOL, and the MOBA genre altogether, and make HOTS a seperate and totally new thing. There was this arrogance about that announcement video that made me want HOTS to fail.

If Blizzard came out and said this is our take on the MOBA genre, by scaling back certain things, and so on and so forth, I would have been more receptive. I still gave the game a shot, but my mindset going in wasn't favourable.",1560189878,40,1560186278.0
49,__Hello_my_name_is__,"&gt; feels like a lot of money went down the drain that could have gone into game development.

That's not really how that works, though. It's not like they had a budget and went ""How much of this will go to esports instead of development?"". For better or worse, the higher ups at Blizzard decided that esports will be a big part of Overwatch, and they spent a *tremendous* amount of money on it (and still do).

But at the same time, the Overwatch team is also the best supported of the dev teams out there at Blizzard. Hearthstone, Starcraft and Heroes of the Storm players would *love* to get even half as many content and QoL updates as Overwatch gets these days. And that sure as hell has to do with Blizzard's esports strategy.

So if Blizzard were to cut the esports budget, they sure as hell would also cut the developer budget of the game by just as much. And if they had never invested that much to begin with, the devs most likely would not have gotten as much support, either.",1561458257,18,1561454657.0

Heroes of the Storm, The Division 2, Star Wars the Old Republic, Elder Scrolls Online, Overwatch and Assassins Creed Odyssey.

Until i finally started to notice its not any fun at all and more than just work, i felt compelled to do all that.

So i just stopped.

I only play SP games now because these GaaS games are just not my thing, i dont want recurring minor doses of content, i want to play the game, maybe get some DLC and then i want it to be done.

For example, the most recent Hero, Anduin, doesn’t properly animate his lips when speaking. Someone asked about it and they said that not only was it not worth their time to fix, but they wouldn’t do it on any hero going forward. Its a top down MOBA, who cares about lip sync?

73,Clbull,"Heroes of the Storm died because Blizzard upheld lengthy silence penalties over petty sarcastic remarks. [This is a screenshot I took of a (deleted) forum thread](https://i.imgur.com/GTerOhq.png) where someone got his 256 day silence upheld over some of the lamest E rated chat ever. [I also verified with this guy that it was that long.](https://i.imgur.com/Vkxsnme.png)

To explain how and why the silence was this long, Blizzard introduced a new silence penalty in 2015. The first silence is 24 hours while subsequent silences are doubled in duration. It takes just 10 silences to be penalized for a year and a half (512 days.) Streamers like Asmongold, Grubby and Chu8 quickly exposed the system as being an automated one where reports are not investigated at all by customer support. This has led to players abusing the report system to get others unfairly banned. Blizzard also changed Heroes of the Storm in 2016 to ban silenced players from queuing for Ranked matches, adding actual weight to chat bans.

The worst part is that Blizzard worked to actually censor players complaining about the system, first by deleting any forum threads complaining about their overly excessive abusive chat policy, then by ignoring every question raising concerns about the game's broken report system in [a (relevant) AMA last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8bzsup/ama_with_heroes_developers_april_13_2018/), and finally by getting the HotS subreddit mods to remove any posts about the report system.

Overwatch interest is in the toilet, starcraft is kinda dead, diablo as a franchise is MIA for now, heroes of the storm is on life support, WoW is checking into rehab. Hearthstone still okay? Who knows.

As for bethesda?

things bethesda games studios have going for them:

* niche, despite the clamoring from the circlejerk about how the witcherino is the best open world rpg ever, almost no games fill the same extremely specific niche that only BGS games fill

* time, with starfield estimates being 2020 the earliest 

* capital, lots of mtx and a free money pass from the financials with zenimax

* lots of new manpower from their new studio acquisitions and new hires

* a legion of obsequious defenders that will take complaints of the shortcomings of products as personal attacks because of need of validation of their interests and the time spent on those products",1563581980,45,1563578380.0
1,Clbull,"I would have totally believed them, actually.

In 2008, Blizzard came under Activision Blizzard's ownership. Though they insisted that things would be the same, anybody smart enough to not totally bow down and worship the developer could see that Blizzard was making big changes to their games in response to mounting pressure from their corporate overlords.

Want some examples?

* World of Warcraft's mechanics have been dumbed down heavily over the years to cater the game towards the lowest common denominator of stupidity. WoW has also seen increasingly less content pushed out with each new expansion; all they pump expensive microtransactions into a MMO that still costs $14.99 per month to play. There's a reason that Nostalrius, Elysium and Warmane became hugely popular private servers, and that's because they ran on superior versions of the game that Blizzard had long since killed.

* StarCraft II had LAN support gutted out of the game, not due to piracy concerns but because Blizzard wanted complete control over who could host esports events and shut off any unauthorised leagues that didn't pay their sky high royalty fees.

* Blizzard sued KeSPA (the Korean e-Sports Association) in 2010 over royalties. This lawsuit particularly damaged the evolution of the Korean SC2 scene because the only pro players to transition from Brood War to SC2 initially were the shitty b-teamers that would never see any play on a televised stage. It also arguably led to KeSPA killing off Brood War in 2013 by pulling a failed transition to SC2. Now, the Korean SC2 scene is on life support while a grassroots amateur BW scene has evolved from the ashes of the former professional leagues and is still drawing huge crowds.

* Diablo III was initially launched with always-online DRM and remains a game you cannot play offline to this day. On top of this, Blizzard allowed players to buy and sell in-game items for real world money through the use of a real money auction house where they would receive a cut. The loot system in the game was actually so bad and so luck-based that Blizzard had to scrap the RMAH and rework the loot system entirely for the game's expansion, Reaper of Souls.

* Heroes of the Storm originally started out promising, until Blizzard released Loot 2.0, a rework to the game's rewards system which added lootboxes and locked most of the game's cosmetic rewards behind this gambling mechanic. After that update, you could no longer purchase cosmetic items directly and had to grind for or buy lootboxes for a chance to earn specific rewards.

* Blizzard introduced a Silence Penalty into their games in 2015. To explain how it works, if you get reported frequently for being toxic, you get a 24 hour chat mute. Subsequent mutes double in duration with no cap, meaning after just 10 mutes, you will have been silenced for 1023 cumulative days which is almost three fucking years. In later months Blizzard ramped this system up further by barring silenced players from playing Ranked games in Overwatch and HotS. Increasing evidence has surfaced that the system is fully automated and bans players with zero investigation whatsoever after they've been reported a certain number of times. Numerous pros and twitch streamers have been hit with unfair bans from other players griefing them with malicious false reports. It's also allowed multiboxers like PreparedWoW to weaponise the report system against other players they don't like.

* On top of Blizzard's silence penalties, Customer Support has turned increasingly lazy towards addressing ban appeals. There have been a lot of threads on the official Battle.net forums and on the r/heroesofthestorm and r/overwatch subreddits of players being rudely fobbed off by customer support when appealing silences, suspensions and perma bans. Some of these include upholding lengthy silences for E rated sarcastic remarks, upholding perma bans because a player persistently disconnected during a match, etc.",1563618487,34,1563614887.0
2,Clbull,"I am *incredibly* sceptical of Blizzard's attempts to automate their report and cheat detection systems.

Seven years ago, they wrongly banned Diablo III players for running the game on Linux and spent months [denying claims that Warden was flagging Wine as a false-positive](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/7/9/3146129/linux-diablo-3-ban), until they finally bothered to look at the evidence [and realised their own screw-up.](https://news.softpedia.com/news/Blizzard-Admits-Wrongfully-Banning-Diablo-3-Linux-User-Refunds-His-Money-307776.shtml)

Then in 2015, they implemented the Silence Penalty, a chat mute which would restrict a player's ability to message others for 24 hours at first, but would double in duration on each subsequent silence. [Asmongold raised concerns about Blizzard lazily automating the system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG3oGJrdfeE) and his concerns were realised [when he was unfairly muted due to bogus reports live on stream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI&amp;t=1s)

Around that time, a WoW multiboxer (Prepared) maliciously false-reported a player with all 60 of his characters after getting salty over a death in Ashran. Within minutes, that player was perma banned. Unfortunately, even though this incident was caught live on Twitch, the streamer in question has DMCA'd all clips of it, so there's no video proof anymore. Worse, the WoW thread about it was nuked from orbit by Blizzard within hours and no archive of it exists.

Rather than address the criticisms of their report system being automated and leading to unfair uninvestigated punishments, Blizzard silently removed all mention of the Silence penalty on the WoW website (but not the other game sites.) Worse, they doubled down on the automation several times, in 2016 [by preventing silenced players from entering Ranked queues in HotS and Overwatch](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/20111014/ranked-play-revamp-5-6-2016/), in late 2017 [by lowering the threshold for silences to be actioned greatly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnfzzz8pIBE), and in mid-2018 [by replacing silences with suspensions and permanent bans, whilst doing nothing to actually investigate player reports.](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-gb/blog/21701411/heroes-of-the-storm-development-updates-april-12-2018-4-12-2018/)

Asmongold isn't the only victim of Blizzard's report system. Twitch clips of Grubby, Chu8, Kendrick, Bongsoon, King, Bluebeetle and other HotS pros exist of them being slapped with silences. Players were genuinely griefing them with false reports in order to get them unfairly banned, especially when Ranked play was changed to bar silenced players from queuing.

And before you think that Customer Support will help you when the report system is used against you, they're either so understaffed that they have to blindly reject silence appeals to keep within service level, or there's an institutional culture at Blizzard to deem everything and anything in-game offensive and deserving of punishment. There is plenty of evidence of unfair bans going around on r/heroesofthestorm, r/overwatch, r/wow and even the official Battle.net forums. I've seen several month long bans upheld for things as E rated as 'sarcastic remarks' for crying out loud. [Even Grubby's been rudely fobbed off by CS personnel who simply couldn't be arsed to manually investigate his unfair silence.](https://twitter.com/followgrubby/status/884831040258420736?lang=en) He had to get his ban lifted through his internal contacts at Blizzard, and he's a several time WC3 world champion!",1563226363,17,1563222763.0
3,CombatMuffin,"A lot of the stuff you point out has merit, but you are trying hard to match it with Activision, to be honest.

I mean, WoW got simplified/streamlined mechanics, sure, *just like almodt every other AAA videogame has* over the years. It's not unique to Blizzard at all. As gaming has grown, they need to cater to wider, and wider audiences. WoW used to be *huge* because it had 10 million active suscribers. There's games that could say they have that many *concurrently* today. Private servers were popular because they are free and provide a sense of community. They were popular already many years ago, but again: the number of games has grown dramatically.

Korean eSports were famous back in the day, because they popularized the medium, but they aren't the end-all in eSports, not anymore. Plain and simple: SC2 was never as popular as Brood War for various reasons, one of the biggest? RTS games began to die off. You mention huge crowds for Brood War: how huge are those compared to DOTA 2, LoL or streaming crowds? The medium has evolved past that.

Diablo 3 had big problems on launch, no doubt. It failed to meet expectations on several fronts. That's not to say it was Activision's fault, per se. Blizzard made mistakes in the past, but back then, game devs had the luxury of cancelling games with less financial risk. For all its fault, the devs fixed Diablo 3 from a below average game and turned it into a good game. Perhaps not *Blizzard good*, but it's a good game with its own merits. It's understandable they would consider cancelling the second expansion and instead focus on moving on and trying something new.

Heroes of the Storm was troubled from the very start. I was a beta player, and the biggest issues the game had were: they came way too late into the MOBA trend and their streamlined mechanics didn't appeal to many big MOBA players. The loot 2.0 wasn't the big killer, it brought many people back (including me). The biggest hit, if any, was HGC being cancelled last November, and that was due to stock falling, not an inherent issue with the game. The game was already niche.

A flawed reporting system is not indicative of a bad company. It's a flaw that could use work. Streamers being affected are such a minute part of the playerbase that it is statistically meaningless. Blizzard has it's faults, customer support rarely is one (for every big viral post you see, there's probably hundreds or thousands of good customer support cases). 

I have never been silenced in a Blizzard game, and no one I know has, either (and some of them could be considered aggressive and even toxic). This is anecdotal, but it's likely that people who get silenced are already walking on thin ice. It's not easy getting banned unless you are constantly getting reported and again: if it's a streamer getting griefed, then that's a very small, particular case compared to the millions of players the system was designed to work with.

Like I said above, Blizzard is not without its faults, but they had their faults back in their golden days, too. The game industry has evolved past that and some of the pros of being so big bring some of the corporate cons along. This isn't unique to Blizzard, or even the big three (Ubi, EA, Activision): any big enough publisher has some of the corporate issues.",1563634941,17,1563631341.0
4,Blenderhead36,"It's not a secret.  What happened was Games as a Service.

WoW is one of the oldest GaaS games still on the market.  They moved their development model to make all their games like World of Warcraft.  This has been going on for some time--I remember the uproar when it was announced that LAN play would not be a component of Starcraft II.  In 2009, that was heresy.

Diablo III was a pioneer product in this sense, with the game held up by the Auction House, until it was reluctantly removed.  Reports have confirmed that there were plans for more than just Reaper of Souls and Rise of the Necromancer for Diablo III, but they were axed by management after the revenue stream was shut off.

Next came Hearthstone, a F2P title.  Everyone who played Hearthstone noticed how the releases kept speeding up.  First it was 2 sets a year.  Then 3, 1 small and 2 big.  Then it was 3 big.  I believe the current set up is that the 3 big sets each have a little one tucked in; I stopped playing in 2017, so I don't really know.

Heroes of the Storm launched with a f2P model, then doubled down on it with the 2.0 update in 2017.

Overwatch debuted with a progression system based entirely around loot boxes in 2016 and literally made a billion dollars.  It was the success story of 2016 across the entire market.

So here we are.  What's going on here?  Why are all these games so expensive to maintain?

Because Activision Blizzard is publicly traded.  Shareholders don't care if they're making breathtaking art or disgusting shovelware--as long as it sells.

Now it's 2019.  They're trying to beat the year that beat the year that beat the year that they grew 150%.  So everything has to be about revenue.  Because this will eventually collapse under its own weight, and Blizzard will become victims of their own success.  There will come a year when they absolutely nail it and are a whopping success...that didn't hit their goals.

And when that happens, heads will roll.

11,waytooeffay,"WoW is still surviving because it’s a literal industry titan, no other MMO has ever come close to the influence WoW has had and its likely none ever will. But if Blizzard doesn’t change their design direction then WoW will likely suffer further - the most recent expansion has already caused a bunch of long-term players to quit because of Blizzard’s questionable design choices and story development. And it’s not just players, several of Blizzard’s higher level designers and executives have left the company within the last year. I doubt WoW will actually die any time soon, but Blizzard definitely needs to reconnect with the players and learn from their mistakes. 

It’s not only WoW either, all of their games have fallen short of expectations. Overwatch is doing okay, but Diablo, Starcraft, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm have all been on a steady decline over the last few years in terms of player numbers as well as just the general sentiment surrounding the games coming from their respective communities. I’m not entirely sure about Overwatch because I haven’t played it in years, but when it comes to every single one of their other games the players seem to be losing faith at an escalating pace.",1563791047,1,1563787447.0
12,danhern,"Brood and meepo are not strong heroes by themselves. Brood has historically been terrible outside of the deathball metagame or splitpushing heavy metagame, which has happened about twice in the history of dota. Other than that brood is such a low impact hero after the laning phase, gets countered by sentry wards during lane, and even if brood gets like 5 kills during laning phase she cant transition into having a large presence on the map because of the way the web works.

Storm spirit, slark, enigma, and anti mage do not need counters to be beaten at all. Storm spirit is another hero that does really badly in the late game, but does well mid game, while also getting countered by stuns, kotl, bloodseeker, scythe of vyse, orchid, silences, etc. If he loses the early game then he instantly loses the game too as he becomes useless mid gamd.

Slark loses to all the same stuff except he scales better than storm. But he doesnt really have any counters, but hes just not that good at team fighting and doesnt have anything to offer other than a good right click since pounce is much worse with 5 people. 

Enigma is a support that needs items and farm to work. This character is another than can be shut down easily by proper planning in the early game and ganks. He cant win a game by himself though.

Anti mage... hes just a carry. Just win the game before minute 40 and dont feed him. Sure hes good in the late game but not every game needs to make it there. Of course a 6 slotted hard carry is gonna be good against a team with no counter picks.",1565173126,1,1565169526.0

15,_Panda,"&gt; In DOTA if you lose, its 99% your fault because even in the worst match up you could always make up for your shortcomings with items.

I actually disagree, DotA hero/team matchups can be significantly more swingy than in League. Sure you can buy a lot more answers in DotA to help shore up weaknesses (for instance, you can buy stuns, silences, and mobility in DotA while in League these tools are largely limited to hero kits), but the power level of hero skills and especially ults is also much higher.

For instance, there's nothing in League that compares to facing a last-pick uncountered Broodmother or Meepo. Even heroes like Storm Spirit, Slark, Anti-mage, Enigma, or many others can result in basically unwinnable games from hero select. Of course, that usually that means you have a significant weakness in your draft, but it's related to the fact that drafting/hero selection is significantly harder in DotA due to less hero homogenization when compared to League.",1565165598,1,1565161998.0

21,Clbull,"&gt; it is the single worst esport ever from a spectator perspective, the combination of it being a BR and the building makes it impossible to see what's going on.

In my opinion MOBAs are far worse as esports. For several reasons:

1. They are inherently hard to understand, due to the sheer plethora of heroes, abilities, item builds, masteries, talents, etc. For the spectator, this means a lot of great plays will go straight over their head.

2. The draft phase consists of commentators having a fully blown nerd-off over potential hero picks from each team. Few of these casters really explain what makes a good team comp, why a certain hero pick would be significant, and most of the audience is left bewildered and confused. The only players who truly understand are the hardcore competitive ones. This has been my experience from watching pro Dota 2, League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm and pretty much any MOBA. I even have this issue when spectating any Overwatch League matches.

3. MOBAs are the only genre which forbid you to main a single character or race. Unlike with RTS, fighting, FPS and even digital TCGs where you can excel with one option, playing a single character in a MOBA is known as 'one tricking' and is highly discouraged, to the point of it being a bannable offence in some games. Do you think Super Smash Bros Melee or Street Fighter II would have been as successful as they were if players had to sit in a draft pick menu for 5 mins before each match banning 3 characters each before they could pick their final roster? Heck, do you think Overwatch would have done so well if the game had similar character selection restrictions as a traditional MOBA? Fuck no!

4. A lot of MOBAs suffer from bland and uninspired hero design, which means that a lot of heroes tend to be homogenised to perform the same role and become boring to both the player and the spectator.

I quit overwatch during season 2 so I can't speak for that. I'm surprised it's still even being talked about honestly. It was always an unbalanced shitshow to me.

Heroes of the Storm made a valiant effort but people just didn't like it. I actually enjoyed it for what it was but good luck getting people away from DotA or league of legends. Many mobas have failed trying. Some much more fun than all three to me but those playerbases are loyal as hell.

Diablo three was such a mess for so long it was never gonna recover. I hear it's fun now but it's too late for me to try and get back into it. 

Sadly I think the RTS genre is pretty much dead so I don't really see a new Warcraft or StarCraft pulling them up.

29,Clbull,"I am *incredibly* sceptical of Blizzard's attempts to automate their report and cheat detection systems.

Seven years ago, they wrongly banned Diablo III players for running the game on Linux and spent months [denying claims that Warden was flagging Wine as a false-positive](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/7/9/3146129/linux-diablo-3-ban), until they finally bothered to look at the evidence [and realised their own screw-up.](https://news.softpedia.com/news/Blizzard-Admits-Wrongfully-Banning-Diablo-3-Linux-User-Refunds-His-Money-307776.shtml)

Then in 2015, they implemented the Silence Penalty, a chat mute which would restrict a player's ability to message others for 24 hours at first, but would double in duration on each subsequent silence. [Asmongold raised concerns about Blizzard lazily automating the system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG3oGJrdfeE) and his concerns were realised [when he was unfairly muted due to bogus reports live on stream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI&amp;t=1s)

Around that time, a WoW multiboxer (Prepared) maliciously false-reported a player with all 60 of his characters after getting salty over a death in Ashran. Within minutes, that player was perma banned. Unfortunately, even though this incident was caught live on Twitch, the streamer in question has DMCA'd all clips of it, so there's no video proof anymore. Worse, the WoW thread about it was nuked from orbit by Blizzard within hours and no archive of it exists.

Rather than address the criticisms of their report system being automated and leading to unfair uninvestigated punishments, Blizzard silently removed all mention of the Silence penalty on the WoW website (but not the other game sites.) Worse, they doubled down on the automation several times, in 2016 [by preventing silenced players from entering Ranked queues in HotS and Overwatch](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/20111014/ranked-play-revamp-5-6-2016/), in late 2017 [by lowering the threshold for silences to be actioned greatly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnfzzz8pIBE), and in mid-2018 [by replacing silences with suspensions and permanent bans, whilst doing nothing to actually investigate player reports.](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-gb/blog/21701411/heroes-of-the-storm-development-updates-april-12-2018-4-12-2018/)

Asmongold isn't the only victim of Blizzard's report system. Twitch clips of Grubby, Chu8, Kendrick, Bongsoon, King, Bluebeetle and other HotS pros exist of them being slapped with silences. Players were genuinely griefing them with false reports in order to get them unfairly banned, especially when Ranked play was changed to bar silenced players from queuing.

And before you think that Customer Support will help you when the report system is used against you, they're either so understaffed that they have to blindly reject silence appeals to keep within service level, or there's an institutional culture at Blizzard to deem everything and anything in-game offensive and deserving of punishment. There is plenty of evidence of unfair bans going around on r/heroesofthestorm, r/overwatch, r/wow and even the official Battle.net forums. I've seen several month long bans upheld for things as E rated as 'sarcastic remarks' for crying out loud. [Even Grubby's been rudely fobbed off by CS personnel who simply couldn't be arsed to manually investigate his unfair silence.](https://twitter.com/followgrubby/status/884831040258420736?lang=en) He had to get his ban lifted through his internal contacts at Blizzard, and he's a several time WC3 world champion!",1563226363,17,1563222763.0

She murdered hordes of both angels and demons, armed with riduculous and sexy poses/innuendos/executions in a variety of ways. Her hair is possessed by a demon, and not to mention most of her stronger moves (aka the stuff she has for her smash attacks) pretty much leave her naked in the original two games since both the giant limbs and her suit are made out of her magic demon-possesed hair.

Granted, she isn't as 'gruesiomely evil' as the lord of terror, but still.

12,quickupvote,"If a company shows that they're willing to abandon a portion of their userbase for the sake of chasing a *potentially* larger userbase, they are seen as untrustworthy. This is not a good thing because it drags their brand name into the mud in addition to admitting to everybody that they're willing to abandon their userbase at the drop of a hat, therefore discouraging their users from investing time and money into their products, especially in the long run.

On top of that, the dissatisfied customers do not actually disappear; they instead stick around to remind future customers of that company's untrustworthiness. And the more that company abandon their users (kinda like how the PC/console Diablo 3 fanbase got shafted with Diablo Mobile), the louder these dissatisfied customers will be.

And lastly, it's important to remember that when a company abandons their fanbases, any other company can snatch them and make a profit off of them. Valve snatched Dota from Blizzard and they made millions out of it, even breaking world records in the process... and Heroes of the Storm basically crashed and burned because of it.

0,F0REM4N,"I’m not sure how you define most. In the states fast food does not receive exemption from sales tax, and is not eligible for purchase with food benefits. Other than that it is still ridiculously cheap, and it’s actually been proven that it triggers the same dopamine responses seen in drug addicts. So in that light, yes I’m aware of that. 

Personally I don’t like to have my choices limited based on the behavior of others, especially if those others are a very small minority. That’s why I bring up the question of deterring in where we draw the line between consumer choice and consumer protection.

In gaming, heroes of the storm has a beautiful loot box system. It’s totally free to play, the loot boxes can be earned in game easily, and they are for cosmetic items only. I am not sure I’m willing to give that up because one dude (or 1% of people) can’t seem to control their impulses.

If someone truly *does* have an issue with these systems, there is a fair chance that they have similar control issues in other areas of their life, so it also feels like they are being used as scapegoats to push the real crutch of this issue, many gamers simply don’t like these systems.

3,rajikaru,"&gt; You want to talk about a game that takes cues from MOBAs but leaves out the engaging elements, that's a perfect description of Heroes of the Storm

HOTS takes out elements that make MOBAs troublesome and overly complicated (items, the runes system in league, the extra mechanics like day/night cycles and power-ups in dota) and streamlines what else they take, in order to make a MOBA so solid in its core that it can do things League and Dota couldn't dream of doing. It made a single character that's controlled by two players (Cho'gall), a character with a mechanic that allows them to respawn immediately (Diablo), a character that can turn into a turret (ragnaros), a character that's basically zerg rush personified (murky), and other weird concepts, while combining them with more traditionally designed moba characters, and still creating a fun environment, as well as bringing variety to the map and gameplay design around it by offering different objectives based on each map. 

They also translated almost every overwatch character as faithfully as possible, and after Tracer, still continued to re-iterate on their designs, giving them better skins, more diverse skillsets, and disctinct gameplay styles yet retaining their original Overwatch flair. 

It's fair to say that HOTS isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I think the fact that its talent tree system was actually implemented into DOTA2 is argument enough that it's your opinion that it isn't engaging and nothing more. HOTS isn't perfect but it's been doing a lot for the MOBA genre that League and DOTA2 couldn't even dream of, and I respect that.

&gt; Overwatch keeps the elements appropriate for an FPS and leaves the ones that would be clunky or out of place and it works very well. 

Some would say it's too streamlined. Like I said, once you understand a character's skills, there isn't much left to learn, and there isn't much leeway in their gameplay. If you've learned how to headshot as McCree, you've learned how to play McCree.

4,sand-which,"&gt; None of this alters how the game works when it's good.

I would argue that it does, becuase it makes the chances that it's good happen less often imo. 

&gt; Drafting still works without exclusivity.

It is still functional, but it's worse. There's heroes that have very rich, and interesting pools of counter picks, but if you can just solve an enemy Storm Spirit pick with picking a Storm Spirit yourself, that's boring. The game then just becomes about which of those players has a better Storm game. It actively removes interesting elements of the game, and I'm sure that games would devolve into that. 

&gt; Cooperating with or relying on a bot is not distinct from working alongside one rando stranger.

It definitely is, a bot is not something you can communicate ideas with. You can't tell a bot to come over here to smoke gank someone, or to tell it to play around rosh pit to get pickoffs. Saying this might make sense in a game like CSGO or something, but playing with a bot in a dota is close to a loss.

Right now, if someone abandons a game in dota, their hero instanlty walks back to base, but any other player on their team can take control of that hero and play as both their own hero and that hero. 

&gt; This is for when someone completely fails to cooperate. By your own estimate that happens in one out of five games. For games which are long, difficult, and consequential, that is entirely too often.

I think I said 1 out of 10, if I didn't I misspoke because that is what I believe. And like, I would argue every single online game has this problem where 1 out of 10 games are not a great experience. 

Also, this ties in a big discourse in the dota community: should there be a surrender button? And the answer to that is no, because in dota (unlike other mobas), there is genuinely always a way to comeback. In League, an insane percentage of games are ended as soon as you're able to surrender, because everyone gives up and just clicks surrender. I feel like this actually adds more toxicity to games weirdly enough, because if you have a bad early game all it takes is 2 players to go ""gg just surrender at 15 mintues"" to ruin the team's mindset. They give up, other players give up, and it's bad

Sorry for that tangent, but why I brought it up is because for the same reason, if you allow leavers in the game (or people to be kicked), it will happen so often and ruin more games than are being ruined right now. A carry dies and no supports come to help him? He just leaves right away in a rage, and the game ends because now it's 4v5, even with a bot. Dota right now gives the money generating from a left player to the other 4 players, and it doesn't do enough. Allowing leavers or kickers would ruin more games of dota, straight up

There is always room for improvement. Its also an absurd amount of room for improvement. There is always more to learn. There is an absurd amount of knowledge to know. I dont play ranked but Im probably a 3k pleb with my 3600+hours. The difference between my ability and a 4k player is a lot. The difference between a 4k and a 5k player is absurd. The difference between a 5k player and a 6k is monumental. And above them all, once you hit immortal, you have pros who can earn millions by being the best. Im not the competitive type nor do I have the time to put in and become super good at the game, but I can boot up even the most casual of games and learn something new. Its not just deep, its absurdly deep. And when you look at coaches doing drafts, you can tell that the depth of the game at the competitive level, not just ranked, but competitive, is just beyond comprehension of mortal mind. But its still fun to theorycraft all the same. 3k leaves me at a bit above average. Most consider sub 4.5k to be ""bad"". Like I can look at my play and objectively say its bad and it takes significant improvement until I consider a person ""decent"" at the game.

There is also this incredible sense of wonder and exploration of the game everytime Icefrog dumps out a new patch. The saddest period of dota was when Icefrog tried out the shitty ""small patch every 2 weeks"" bull shit. The massive, game altering, mechanic altering, item altering, build altering, tempo altering patches are what I fucking live for and those first days, weeks of experimentation, fucking about and unknowns despite racking up thousands of hours, its like a whole new game. And the play space isnt fully explored, there is so much to learn, so much intricacy, so much mechanics and hero interactions. You are unlikely to roll the same hero line ups in the same lanes and even if you do, small difference can snowball rapidly creating very different games. And the choices at every step of the game matter and impact further down the line. The decision to leave the lane to go pull and then gank mid would result in a very different game than if you had stayed in lane and harassed hard enough to perhaps put them into a kill threshhold with some smart play. I played some Heroes of the Storm, a dumbed down version of Dota and it felt terrible. Where was the creativity? The freedom to do something unexpected yet novel? The lanes should be fluid, the strategies should be fluid. In League the closest thing that remains would be proxy singed probably. I dislike how streamlined item builds end up being. There are just some things that are objectively ideal to build as 1 then 2 then 3. Although there are some newer shenanigans coming out due to the new rune system (mostly still top lane).

The buddy element. I have a stack, in total, its about 5-7 routine players, and an additional 4-6 less routine players. Its an important social thing for me to hop on after 8 hours of work, pop open discord ""what up dickheads, lets queue from meme turbo games"". One of them is in London right now (we play from Australia), some of them go interstate, some of them are really busy with their work life or personal life or whatever, but you can always find some time in the evening for a game or two.

The game is just deep beyond anything else that has really drawn me in. It requires no grinding to enjoy compared to say eve online and yet at the same time I consider people with less than 100 hours to be tutorial level understanding of dota.",1569866753,1,1569863153.0

17,ohoni,"&gt; i don't see being able to speed up the refresh as being a problem... provided it doesn't cost any real money to do so it won't fall foul of any laws.

Ok, if it doesn't cost money, sure. The issue would be if you *can* spend money to speed it up. 

Basically,

A. You're offered 6 items. If you buy one or more of the items (which you can do using money), then it resets, offering a random selection of new items. Otherwise it either next resets, or resets on a slower timetable. 

B. You're offered 6 items. If you don't like those 6, you can pay a cash fee to reset them. Otherwise it either next resets, or resets on a slower timetable. 

C. You're offered 6 items. Whether you buy them all or don't buy any, it will reset every 6 hours. Even if you clear them out, you're stuck with a dead store until then, so no amount of spending resets it. 

Only C would not be gambling. In both A and B, you're given an option to spend money to get a new selection of goods. 

&gt;I might be being naive here, because there must be a reason why in other games such as Heroes of the Storm the premium currency is kept entirely separate from the in-game currency.

There might be loopholes companies are skating in some cases, but for the most part when a game has ""cash currencies"" and ""non-cash currencies,"" the separation is more so that they can offer benefits that can only be purchased using cash. It can be more complicated than that, particularly in games will way more than two currencies.",1569937671,1,1569934071.0
18,Ultramaann,"You're taking the announcement out of context and making it seem more ubiquitous than it really was. Before Blizzcon, about two months I believe, Blizzard said something along the lines of ""it being a very good time to be a Diablo fan"" and said that there was a major announcement that was going to be at Blizzcon for the franchise. It's important to remember that Diablo has not received any major announcement in close to a decade, and the fans had been, as far as I know, pretty patient in their waiting for one. Then, a week or so before Blizzcon, after most people bought their tickets, they released an odd, vague statement telling fans to temper expectations that flew in the face of their earlier hyping. While I'm not a big Diablo fan I did follow community reactions around this period and I would say the reaction to this announcement was fair. Most people expressed confusion but pulled back their expectations to perhaps a Diablo 2 remaster ala Starcraft.

Then came Blizzcon. Warcraft gets a remaster announcement, which encourages people that believe Diablo will get the same treatment. Then, for their final, major announcement, which the biggest reveals are held for, Diablo Immortal is announced, a free to play mobile game not even developed by Blizzard.

It was the perfect storm of error and I fail to see how anyone can not see the problem in their timing. Later on, it would be revealed that Diablo 4 originally *was* planned to be announced at this keynote but there was a behind the scenes upset at Blizzard resulting in the delay or cancellation of multiple projects. I also think it's unfair to act like mobile gaming is just simply a 'different platform' and not only a platform that is constantly associated not only with a predatory freemium economy, but also a platform repeatedly associated with lack of depth in the games present there. It's also important to remember that Blizzard fans in general have had a growing concern over the state of Blizzard after the release of the most recent WoW expansion- a mobile announcement for a freemium game to an audience that had never expressed interest in this market seemed to confirm these fears. 

I'm certainly not condoning death threats or anything but the disappointment is far from classic Gamer Rage. It wasnt a bad announcement, but imagine if instead of Fallout 4, only Fallout Shelter was announced, or a Cyberpunk mobile game two years ago after the teasing. It was terribly timed and it probably shouldnt have been announced at Blizzcon to begin with, but making it the major announcement of the evening was just bad decision making.",1570120009,1,1570116409.0
19,Fozra_,"Overwatch is probably their best new IP, but even that has waned over the past year or so. Hearthstone is successful, but everyone recognises that it’s aimed at the casual player - not that there’s anything inherently wrong with that, but it’s a theme in Blizzard games that is very hit and miss.

Heroes of the Storm died because they refused to do anything but cater to casuals. LoL and Dota are far more complex and infinitely more successful. The vast majority of criticism of WoW in recent expansions has been how casual it’s become. Diablo 3’s biggest issue is lack of depth and difficulty.

Casual works in some genres: a card game I can play on my phone while I poop, for example. It doesn’t work in MOBAs, it doesn’t work in MMO endgame, and it doesn’t work in ARPGs. 

IMO PoE goes too far the other way, but it’s still far more popular than D3 is. If D4 can land somewhere between D3 and PoE, it’ll be a huge success, but there’s nobody who has ‘faith’ in Diablo 4 like they had in Diablo 3, and that’s going to matter.",1570191554,1,1570187954.0

22,rajikaru,"&gt; You want to talk about a game that takes cues from MOBAs but leaves out the engaging elements, that's a perfect description of Heroes of the Storm

HOTS takes out elements that make MOBAs troublesome and overly complicated (items, the runes system in league, the extra mechanics like day/night cycles and power-ups in dota) and streamlines what else they take, in order to make a MOBA so solid in its core that it can do things League and Dota couldn't dream of doing. It made a single character that's controlled by two players (Cho'gall), a character with a mechanic that allows them to respawn immediately (Diablo), a character that can turn into a turret (ragnaros), a character that's basically zerg rush personified (murky), and other weird concepts, while combining them with more traditionally designed moba characters, and still creating a fun environment, as well as bringing variety to the map and gameplay design around it by offering different objectives based on each map. 

They also translated almost every overwatch character as faithfully as possible, and after Tracer, still continued to re-iterate on their designs, giving them better skins, more diverse skillsets, and disctinct gameplay styles yet retaining their original Overwatch flair. 

It's fair to say that HOTS isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I think the fact that its talent tree system was actually implemented into DOTA2 is argument enough that it's your opinion that it isn't engaging and nothing more. HOTS isn't perfect but it's been doing a lot for the MOBA genre that League and DOTA2 couldn't even dream of, and I respect that.

&gt; Overwatch keeps the elements appropriate for an FPS and leaves the ones that would be clunky or out of place and it works very well.

They also translated almost every overwatch character as faithfully as possible, and after Tracer, still continued to re-iterate on their designs, giving them better skins, more diverse skillsets, and disctinct gameplay styles yet retaining their original Overwatch flair. 

It's fair to say that HOTS isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I think the fact that its talent tree system was actually implemented into DOTA2 is argument enough that it's your opinion that it isn't engaging and nothing more. HOTS isn't perfect but it's been doing a lot for the MOBA genre that League and DOTA2 couldn't even dream of, and I respect that.

&gt; Overwatch keeps the elements appropriate for an FPS and leaves the ones that would be clunky or out of place and it works very well. 

Some would say it's too streamlined. Like I said, once you understand a character's skills, there isn't much left to learn, and there isn't much leeway in their gameplay. If you've learned how to headshot as McCree, you've learned how to play McCree. There aren't unique mechanics (and if there are, they're removed because they don't fit the vision of the character), there isn't nuance beyond being accurate with your shots, and since almost every ultimate in the game boils down to ""Press X to kill/Press X to not die"", the gameplay cycle itself is all there is to it. 

For what it's worth the game itself is solid. Overwatch wasn't super hyped, especially during its beta period, for nothing. There is a lot of fun to be had in learning characters. It's just... once you learn them, which doesn't take a long time, there's nothing else to the gameplay outside of playing the competitive mode or grinding for lootboxes.",1568131668,1,1568128068.0
34,sand-which,"&gt; None of this alters how the game works when it's good.

I would argue that it does, becuase it makes the chances that it's good happen less often imo. 

&gt; Drafting still works without exclusivity.

It is still functional, but it's worse. There's heroes that have very rich, and interesting pools of counter picks, but if you can just solve an enemy Storm Spirit pick with picking a Storm Spirit yourself, that's boring. The game then just becomes about which of those players has a better Storm game. It actively removes interesting elements of the game, and I'm sure that games would devolve into that. 

&gt; Cooperating with or relying on a bot is not distinct from working alongside one rando stranger.

It definitely is, a bot is not something you can communicate ideas with. You can't tell a bot to come over here to smoke gank someone, or to tell it to play around rosh pit to get pickoffs. Saying this might make sense in a game like CSGO or something, but playing with a bot in a dota is close to a loss.

Right now, if someone abandons a game in dota, their hero instanlty walks back to base, but any other player on their team can take control of that hero and play as both their own hero and that hero. 

&gt; This is for when someone completely fails to cooperate. By your own estimate that happens in one out of five games. For games which are long, difficult, and consequential, that is entirely too often.

I think I said 1 out of 10, if I didn't I misspoke because that is what I believe. And like, I would argue every single online game has this problem where 1 out of 10 games are not a great experience. 

Also, this ties in a big discourse in the dota community: should there be a surrender button? And the answer to that is no, because in dota (unlike other mobas), there is genuinely always a way to comeback. In League, an insane percentage of games are ended as soon as you're able to surrender, because everyone gives up and just clicks surrender. I feel like this actually adds more toxicity to games weirdly enough, because if you have a bad early game all it takes is 2 players to go ""gg just surrender at 15 mintues"" to ruin the team's mindset. They give up, other players give up, and it's bad

Sorry for that tangent, but why I brought it up is because for the same reason, if you allow leavers in the game (or people to be kicked), it will happen so often and ruin more games than are being ruined right now. A carry dies and no supports come to help him? He just leaves right away in a rage, and the game ends because now it's 4v5, even with a bot. Dota right now gives the money generating from a left player to the other 4 players, and it doesn't do enough. Allowing leavers or kickers would ruin more games of dota, straight up

&gt; What part of this is a ""compromise?""

I hope you can see why a lot of these are compromises on the vision of dota, and like as someone who hasn't played it, unfortunately you might just have to take mine, and everyone else who plays, word for it",1568925792,1,1568922192.0

17,Clbull,"Heroes of the Storm did not die due to gameplay issues, or because it came on the market far later than other MOBA titles. It haemorrhaged most of its player base due to Blizzard pandering to player feedback and outrage culture long before they pulled the plug on HGC and most of the development team.

Let me explain, Blizzard revamped the report system for all their games back in 2015 and implemented a silence penalty.  A silence is a chat mute which initially lasts for 24 hours but doubles in duration each time a player is silenced with no upper limit. Blizzard claim that players frequently reported for abusive chat are investigated by Customer Support before being silenced. A lot of evidence has surfaced that this is complete bullshit and players frequently reported will get automatically banned with zero investigation. [Asmongold was the first one to prove this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI) and many other people have fallen victim to abuse of the report function. There have even been cases of multiboxers (players who play multiple characters at once) in WoW successfully weaponising the report system against other players to get them unfairly banned.

In 2016, Blizzard selectively doubles down on player feedback and ban silenced players from queuing for Ranked matches in both Overwatch and Heroes. As a result, reports are used to grief streamers like Grubby, chu8, Kendrick and others. Grubby in particular had his silence appeal blindly rejected by Customer Support despite zero evidence of toxic behaviour, so he had to use his internal contacts within Blizzard to get it lifted. 

In late 2017 following more player complaints about the report system, [Jeff Kaplan did an Overwatch development blog about the report system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnfzzz8pIBE), vowing to fine-tune the system and make it punish players more frequently. This change affected all of Blizzard's games, so now players were getting silenced more frequently than ever. At this point I had personally fallen victim to report system abuse and had been silenced 4 times in 2018 alone.

But wait, Customer Support will fix it, right? **WRONG**. Remember Grubby? If that is how Blizzard treat professional gamers with multiple world champion titles, imagine how they'll treat the average joe. Here's a 256 day silence [upheld for sarcastic remarks](https://i.imgur.com/GTerOhq.png). Here's a 128 day mute for [rather inoffensive chat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4o5l07/the_flaws_in_the_mute_system_from_an_experienced/) One player on the HotS subreddit was being fobbed off by Blizzard so much despite having in-game chat disabled that he actually made a fucking subject access request, was told that they had no evidence of chat violations and still upheld his 512 day silence.

What if I told you the HotS development team doubled down even further last year from selectively following player feedback to fit their own agenda? What if I told you that they replaced the silence penalty with a three strikes system (7 day suspension for first penalty, 14 days for the second and a permanent ban thereafter.)",1572692939,1,1572689339.0

24,Megalovania,"I was one of the suckers who bought the Diablo 3 collector's edition and was in for the biggest letdown of the year. To this day I haven't even bothered getting Reaper of Souls because Path of Exile has scratched that particular itch far better than Diablo 3 ever did.

Diablo 4 looked very samey to Diablo 3, which I didn't even really enjoy. Like, if you told me that it was a mod of Diablo 3, I wouldn't have second guessed it. It looks slow, generic, and... I don't know -- dumbed down?

Overwatch was admittedly very fun for the first two weeks or so, but I quickly never touched it again because I felt like I had hit an extremely low skill ceiling.

Heroes of the Storm was just downright garbage. I can't believe they tried to sell heroes for like, $10 each, too.

The latest WoW expansions have been so... generic? Shadowlands doesn't really come across as anything exciting, either -- and honestly, I'm kind of rolling my eyes at how ridiculous they made Sylvanas now.

There was a time when I would stay up till 2am on schoolnights to play some more WC3:FT, and I don't even want to admit how much time I spent *trying* to get good at Brood War. I remember getting a Vex rune in D2:LoD and freaking out -- funny enough, I still remember the first time someone corpse popped me in the original D2. Hell, I remember the butcher from the original Diablo, and the ending to that game like it was yesterday.

In my (controversial) opinion, Blizzard hasn't been 'good' in a long time. There was a time when I would undoubtedly call them the best for PC gaming, but outside of the two weeks I enjoyed Overwatch, it's been about a decade since I was absolutely in love with their games.

Warcraft 3 has just come out and it's taking the world by storm. Is this game an ""addon"" or a ""true sequel""?

Answer before you read the rest of my post. I can't see your answer, but say it out loud, honestly, to yourself. We're on the honor system.

.

Answered yet?

Good.

Now imagine **the exact same game** has come out. But Blizzard feels bad that all the people playing Warcraft 2 multiplayer are now going to have longer queue times and no friends online, so they have released a Warcraft 2 patch so that these players are not ""left behind"" in their out-of-date game. These guys can now load up WC2 and play the same PVP maps as the people playing Warcraft III, using the same units and rules, etc.

In this scenario is Warcraft III an addon or a sequel? Remember that it's the **same game** I asked you about above. So the answer should be the same as the one you gave a moment ago, right?

The reason so many people are *confused* by ""if this is an addon or a sequel"" is because this is the first time a game company has done this. They are doing the **right thing** They are giving a huge chunk of the sequel to their original players, **for free**, just so as not to screw over the playerbase.",1572656119,1,1572652519.0

I never even heard of Gerber before reading this comment.

If you're talking about the subsidiary of Nestlé, it's been very well known and documented that Nestlé in general are an evil corporation. There is already an active boycott that has been going on for decades over their unethical and exploitative strategies of marketing baby formula to developing countries.

The reason why a Nestlé boycott has been ineffective is because the boycott hasn't been that widely publicised, and because many people are unaware of just how many brands are owned by Nestlé.

&gt; They just have to weather the storm. People will go back to begrudgingly buying their products.

I don't think so.

I unsubscribed from WoW, uninstalled every Blizzard game I owned and removed the Battle.net desktop client from my PC in disgust at how Blizzard handled the Blitzchung ruling. If Blizzard went back on their decision, unbanned Blitzchung, reinstated him in Hearthstone Grandmasters, gave him the $10,000 prize money he was due and spoke out in solidarity of Hong Kong, I'd support them again.

A lot of people have gone further than me in this boycott; going so far as to submit account deletion requests. When your information is deleted in this manner, you lose access to any licences you once owned and all data is expunged with no way of recovery. People aren't going to be ""begrudgingly buying"" their products when their account's been nuked from orbit.

Yeah, Warcraft 3 was definitely not just a year to fix. Hell, they just changed a lot of balance stuff within the last year, and most of the remaining War3 players were positive on the changes that I saw, which has certain implications for what was.

&gt;For most of their other games, it took much longer to actually get to a decent state balance wise. Brood War is still a golden example of balancing done right for an asymmetrical game that I'd argue has not been matched, perhaps only by certain patch-eras in DotA.

Oh, Brood War still has plenty of balance issues. Blizzard didn't drop balancing because it was perfect, but because it was good enough and they had largely moved on. Its reputation for amazing balance is a combination of good enough core balance, balancing via maps that was done by the serious leagues, not Blizzard (Blizzard's maps sucked), and an interface and unit AI that's heavily reliant on the player, thus making skill more operative than balance for a lot of things.

And there's still plenty of things that are balanced awkwardly. Mutas would almost certainly be OP without the 12-unit control cap, dragoons would be OP if they didn't have bugged pathfinding, the whole matchup of ZvZ is fucking terrible, etc. People exaggerate just how good the balance is in BW.

Can't speak to the others, but for SC2 I'm not sure the balance has ever been better. I see a huge variety of play both on ladder (I'm D1) and pro games. ZvZ is vastly superior now to HotS or WoL, or BW. Like, it's not even fucking close how much better it is now.

I still play heroes of the storm semi-frequently and casually because so much of my time in game is playing the fun parts of the game aka teamfights or beating out solo lane. when i got burnt out on mobas I started playing CSGO, because it is a team game where 1-3 people on a team playing cohesively with a solid strategy and personal skill can easily win you the game, where in mobas 1 person on your team doing poorly can easily lose you the game. If a game asks me to commit over 40 minutes to a single match it just isn't worth it for me in my adult life, especially when the chances of someone trolling and not even playing the game is so high. Every time i queue up a match of any game i accept the close to 50% chance of losing, what is frustrating is the possibility of someone on your team purposefully trying to sabotage the game in order to have a laugh - moba communities just seem way too full of those people, and at least in CSGO casual you can boot the guy.",1572446295,1,1572442695.0

I never even heard of Gerber before reading this comment.

If you're talking about the subsidiary of Nestlé, it's been very well known and documented that Nestlé in general are an evil corporation. There is already an active boycott that has been going on for decades over their unethical and exploitative strategies of marketing baby formula to developing countries.

The reason why a Nestlé boycott has been ineffective is because the boycott hasn't been that widely publicised, and because many people are unaware of just how many brands are owned by Nestlé.

&gt; They just have to weather the storm. People will go back to begrudgingly buying their products.

I don't think so.

I unsubscribed from WoW, uninstalled every Blizzard game I owned and removed the Battle.net desktop client from my PC in disgust at how Blizzard handled the Blitzchung ruling. If Blizzard went back on their decision, unbanned Blitzchung, reinstated him in Hearthstone Grandmasters, gave him the $10,000 prize money he was due and spoke out in solidarity of Hong Kong, I'd support them again.

A lot of people have gone further than me in this boycott; going so far as to submit account deletion requests. When your information is deleted in this manner, you lose access to any licences you once owned and all data is expunged with no way of recovery. People aren't going to be ""begrudgingly buying"" their products when their account's been nuked from orbit.

So many people have been submitting account deletion requests that the servers handling said requests have been down; and this temporary outage was spun into hyperbolic claims about Blizzard deliberately preventing players from deleting their accounts, despite evidence to the contrary.",1570834687,1,1570831087.0

And while you can discuss balance issues in games all day, I think the most important factor to look at in blizzard's early games is their systems and design approach compared to their modern games.

Yeah, Warcraft 3 was definitely not just a year to fix. Hell, they just changed a lot of balance stuff within the last year, and most of the remaining War3 players were positive on the changes that I saw, which has certain implications for what was.

&gt;For most of their other games, it took much longer to actually get to a decent state balance wise. Brood War is still a golden example of balancing done right for an asymmetrical game that I'd argue has not been matched, perhaps only by certain patch-eras in DotA.

Oh, Brood War still has plenty of balance issues. Blizzard didn't drop balancing because it was perfect, but because it was good enough and they had largely moved on. Its reputation for amazing balance is a combination of good enough core balance, balancing via maps that was done by the serious leagues, not Blizzard (Blizzard's maps sucked), and an interface and unit AI that's heavily reliant on the player, thus making skill more operative than balance for a lot of things.

And there's still plenty of things that are balanced awkwardly. Mutas would almost certainly be OP without the 12-unit control cap, dragoons would be OP if they didn't have bugged pathfinding, the whole matchup of ZvZ is fucking terrible, etc. People exaggerate just how good the balance is in BW.

With all that said, enough time has passed that it's probably safe to assume that the rate of content we're getting *now* is probably the rate of content we should expect to see going forward under the current team.

2. Diablo IV is also really likely, given recent leaks. Diablo II Remastered could happen, but with the Classic Games team hard at work on getting WC3 Reforged released and maintaining Brood War Remastered, I don't see this happening anytime soon.
4. A ""leak"" from an OWL player on Twitter suggested that Overwatch 2 will happen. I doubt it. A standalone single player campaign with a new hero reveal is more likely.

Yeah, Warcraft 3 was definitely not just a year to fix. Hell, they just changed a lot of balance stuff within the last year, and most of the remaining War3 players were positive on the changes that I saw, which has certain implications for what was.

&gt;For most of their other games, it took much longer to actually get to a decent state balance wise. Brood War is still a golden example of balancing done right for an asymmetrical game that I'd argue has not been matched, perhaps only by certain patch-eras in DotA.

Oh, Brood War still has plenty of balance issues. Blizzard didn't drop balancing because it was perfect, but because it was good enough and they had largely moved on. Its reputation for amazing balance is a combination of good enough core balance, balancing via maps that was done by the serious leagues, not Blizzard (Blizzard's maps sucked), and an interface and unit AI that's heavily reliant on the player, thus making skill more operative than balance for a lot of things.

And there's still plenty of things that are balanced awkwardly. Mutas would almost certainly be OP without the 12-unit control cap, dragoons would be OP if they didn't have bugged pathfinding, the whole matchup of ZvZ is fucking terrible, etc. People exaggerate just how good the balance is in BW.

&gt;And while you can discuss balance issues in games all day, I think the most important factor to look at in blizzard's early games is their systems and design approach compared to their modern games.

I don't know if this is true for Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm as well as I didn't play those.

Can't speak to the others, but for SC2 I'm not sure the balance has ever been better. I see a huge variety of play both on ladder (I'm D1) and pro games. ZvZ is vastly superior now to HotS or WoL, or BW. Like, it's not even fucking close how much better it is now.

There's still plenty of room for improvement (especially PvP mid-late game, that shit sucks), but right now I don't think it's any worse than later era BW or War3, and it might be better.",1571563833,1,1571560233.0

0,d20diceman,"My 10, in no particular order: 

**The Batman Arkham series**. I don't know if any game has made me feel as good as I do when I clear some gratuitous arcade challenge in one long flowing combo. It's made me cry more than once (the Mr Freeze DLC and the true ending). I basically want every other game to rip off it's combat. Might turn Witcher or Skyrim into games I want to finish. Above all, it's the incarnation of Batman which is closest to the composite Batman in my head, formed from all my favourite bits of the comics, the animated series and the films.  
(Arkham Asylum was 2009, but it's the one I've revisited the least anyway so I think it's fair to call this a 2010s series).  

**Project M / Project Plus**, the fan made Smash Bros game and IMO the best iteration of the series. The best combination of impossibly-high ceiling, delightfully low floor, seamless online play, a large balanced roster, and so goddamn many fun modes for casual play (""pick a character for each stock"" has become our default way to play). Contains the (pretty good) single player of Brawl, all playable with the modified/expanded roster. Looks great emulated. Development derailed in 2015 but a new team has picked it up, releasing Project Plus earlier this year. No hate for Ultimate or Melee - I'm happy to play literally any Smash game until 4am, but this is the one I'd pick if all the options are available. Probably my favourite game of all time. The only videogame I've sincerely called ""one of the crowning accomplishments of mankind"". 

Almost redundant to list **Dark Souls** here, but would be criminal to leave it off. Hundreds of hours and I barely feel like I've scratched the surface. Mainly I love the coop, playing DS2 and 3 with my partner is one of my favourite gaming memories, but I also spent a long time dueling at that bridge in DS2 and I never stopped encountering people with builds that surprised me. Also, one of my favourite things to watch on Twitch is a small streamer doing a blind first run of a Souls game. To distinguish myself from the hundreds of people who've likely already mentioned DS, I'll note that DS2 was my favourite, followed by 3, and I disliked Bloodbourne (asking me to either farm for healing potions or not have any for bosses killed it).

**The Binding Of Isaac** reignited my love of roguelikes. It's another one where I've played hundreds of hours and still feel like I have a long, long way to go (like I happened to see someone streaming it on Twitch the other day and uh... wow, ""break runs"" huh?). 


**Super Hexagon** is simple, but arguably perfect. Immensly satisfying, gets me into a deep flow state. At one point I was top 100 worldwide in it, which isn't something I've even come close to on any other game. The soundtrack is seared into my soul. If this had daily leaderboards I'd probably play it every day. I'm very rusty these days, but it's still my go-to game for long train/bus journeys - I delete my save and see if I can finish all stages before I reach my destination.   

Speaking of flow state, I have to mention **The Tetris Effect**, specifically playing it with all my HUE lights and RGB devices synced to it, under the influence of a substantial amount of marijuana. Good Lord. I just wish that it had been Lumines (the earlier tetris-like game from the same creator) which had gotten this treatment, because I've not managed to get as into Tetris as I was with Lumines, which I once played for 7 continuous hours. Oh, and would it have killed them to include Vs play? That's such a baseline feature that I didn't even check if the game had it before I purchased. I've put fewer hours into this than any other game on the list, but it was a literally fantastic experience. Can't wait to experience it in VR when I inevitably get an Index.  

It's kinda cheaty to put MtG on here, when the real appeal is the paper game, but **Magic the Gathering: Arena** has been one of my most played PC games. Feels absurdly generous after how much I struggled to get anywhere in Hearthstone - especially since they introduced duplicate protection (booster packs won't give you rare cards you already own the max number of copies for) and made it so F2P players can relatively easily get every rare-and-below card in each set as it comes out. Praise for the economy aside, the main thing is that Arena let's me play *as much Magic as I want*. 3000 games later, it turns out that's a lot of Magic! Tremendously exciting to hear that they plan to add in older cards and eventually support the Pioneer format.  

**Heroes Of The Storm** - I don't think I'll win anyone over to this one. Either you don't like MOBAs, or you've already settled on your MOBA of choice. But as someone who played enough WoW, Diablo and Starcraft for the characters to all be familiar, this is so much fun. Especially the unique characters (Abathur and The Lost Vikings being my favourites). 

**The entire AutoBattler genre**. I'm currently favouring DotA Underlords, but it's too early to call which game (UL, TeamFight Tactics, Hearthstone's new mode, or the original AutoChess) will emerge as the best one. As soon as I played the DotA 2 custom game which started this fad, I fell in love. Elements of Tower Defence, economy management, drafting, battle royale... it does a lot and the overall experience is very compelling. Makes you feel very clever when you do something risky (like pivoting to a totally different alliance mid game) and then come out on top. Duos play with my partner is even more fun. 

**Terraria**. I've bought so many gift copies of this game. My cycle is I draw in new people, the group of us start a new world, we play it obsessively for a few weeks, then people lose interest and I wait for the next people I can talk into trying it. Exploration is so much fun, advancement feels so good, and there's been so much content added for free. I probably haven't seen even half of this game.  

Honourable mentions: 
-**Dicey Dungeons** (which I haven't played long enough to be sure on yet but really seems like something special) 
-**WoW Classic** (I've made more friends playing that game than playing all the other games on this list combined) 
-**Dwarf Fortress** (alpha was available in 2006, game isn't released yet, so I'm not sure if it's too early to be a 2010s game or too late)  
-**Diablo 3** (it's excellent now but I still feel betrayed by how lacking it was at launch)",1574600924,1,1574597324.0

4,Kevimaster,"&gt;Dont you noticed how after CSGO got big nearly every big company came out with their own FPS esport?

&gt;Ubisoft made Siege

&gt;Blizzard made Overwatch

&gt;Microsoft made Halo 5 heavilly influenced by esports

Yeah, I noticed.  That doesn't mean that LoL wasn't first.  You use Blizzard making Overwatch to support that CS:GO made it blow up, but you seem to have forgotten that Blizzard made Heroes of the Storm before that.  Do you not remember the huge flood of mobas that came out after League of Legends and Dota 2 but before all the FPS games you're talking about?

&gt;While LoL and Dota were massive in Asian countries CSGO was MASSIVE in EU/CIS and NA regions which made it more attractive for companies based in that region since it was their market not a foreign one. 

I think you're either massively overestimating how popular CS:GO is/was or you're massively underestimating how popular LoL is/was.  Yeah LoL was a lot bigger in the Asian market than NA or EU.  That doesn't mean LoL wasn't still bigger than CS:GO in both NA and EU.  LoL was (maybe still is, I'm not sure) massively huge in NA and EU.

Don't get me wrong, CS:GO is huge, but League is so big that it makes it look small.  CS:GO's highest concurrent player count is around 850 thousand.  League of Legends' is over 8 million.  CS:GO came out 7 years ago.  At that time League of Legends had more than 3 million average daily concurrent players.  At no point in CS:GO's life has it ever been more popular than LoL.

&gt;The average player/companies look at Mobas and dont know what makes them so popular/impressive. When they look at CSGO esports its inherently obvious why they are so popular.

I don't think this is true.  The problem companies have is that its a lot harder to muscle in on the moba market than it is to make a new FPS game.  Its a lot less risky to make a FPS than it is to make a moba.",1574680314,1,1574676714.0

I know, I know - ""dead game"" but I'm having... well, actually it's hard to say I'm having fun with it. It can be very frustrating when you're getting stomped, but when I'm playing well, it feels great. I can see why people like MOBAs now honestly, though I imagine in other MOBAs there's a lot more room for you to carry your team, while here it's much more of a group effort, and if someone (or me, if I'm being honest) messes up or doesn't help, it's just a slow, painful or brutally fast and painful loss.

I've been playing Quick Play too. 90% of my time with this game was just Vs. AI, but I've finally grown a pair and am venturing into Quick Play. I lose a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get a win, it feels great. When I get MVP, it feels great. I've mostly been playing a Tank character, Anub'arak - hit kit just works for me. It's nice to have something just ""click"" you know? I'm still learning, because Heroes is objective based, there's this weird balance between soaking exp, doing objectives, team-fighting, getting map pressure and ganking, which I could probably do with learning more about, but I think I'm doing okay!",1575238659,1,1575235059.0

14,zcen,"The game developers create the esport so that their game can thrive, not so that an outsider can profit off their scene. Once the calculus makes sense for them to stop or move on, then all the money any outsider invested will be gone. 

Nothing spells this out better than when Blizzard effectively killed their Heroes of the Storm esports scene due to lack of interest and I assume a continuous money sink. Players rarely see success in more than one title/franchise so all that money you spend on your HotS players and team suddenly vanishes.

There is no risk of the creator of basketball saying ""Hey, we're packing up our bags and not doing basketball anymore.""",1574668526,1,1574664926.0
15,Rominiust,"It's definitely hard to be an RTS game this day and age, and doubly so when you release in Early Access like this, triply so with a couple big names coming up (AoE4, WC3 Reforged).

I saw this on steam after a mate mentioned it, and it personally looked like a WC3 mod, reskinned and with different units.  I then saw the price and for a company that I hadn't heard of before (the only game that they're involved with that I've played is Barotrauma, that they publish), it was pretty steep.  It's only about $7 cheaper than WC3 Reforged, which is $44 vs this games $37.

I then saw the steam reviews, it's at mixed at the moment (66% positive), and some of them bring up fairly big negatives, such as the pathfinding being bad, which is pretty killer in an RTS game.  The game needing a 3rd party account (which links to your steam, probably to invite friends and whatnot), which is a bit of a pain since there are plenty of RTS games on steam that don't require that, and let you just invite your steam friends without any other account.  People say the campaign has forced coop (with an AI if you don't have someone to play it with), which is a kinda iffy decision, since I feel like that'd change your playstyle a bit, and as someone who's a fan of turtling (which works fine for the WC3 campaign), it's fairly off-putting.  

Another main negative has to be the early access too, since it's EA the campaign isn't finished, and that's one of the big parts that they're advertising, so I can definitely see people holding off until it's done, which makes them not get as many sales as they would've had the game released.  
On top of that the current campaign apparently doesn't have a save feature, which kinda questions their priorities with the game. 
 A dev commented on a review stating that it wasn't there and they said that ""[having a] saving option is a bit tricky with a co-op campaign, but we're definitely looking into it"", which is not something you want to hear about a campaign, not a ""it's planned"", just a ""maybe"".  

I've seen plenty of games come out and try to force the 'esports' section, only for it to die off &amp; lose track of the other aspects of the game since there are too many competitors, that execute the genre better, out there.  One big example has to be Blizzards MOBA, Heroes of the Storm.  They cancelled the whole esports aspect a year or so ago, and the game's playerbase was pretty decimated from it (there was a recent post about someone spending 3 hours in a queue to try to get into a team ranked (2-5 players) game in the ANZ region, and I can confirm that pretty much every gamemode outside of quickmatch is pretty dead in Australia outside of a specific couple hour window on the weekends).  I'm fine with games like this trying to push the MP component, since that's one of the major aspects, but trying to make everything ""esports ready"" and trying to make that a main aspect of it kinda ruins it a bit in my opinion.

I definitely wanted this game to be good, and fully released, since I super enjoyed playing the Spellforce 3 campaign co-op (which is mainly RTS mixed with a little bit of RPG), and another co-op campaign game sounded great, but there are way too many negatives to buy into it at this stage.

Fairly lengthy post, but tl;dr: Early access wasn't a good idea with the competitors coming up (they probably tried to do this to get some players before they released), especially with how early access it is, while they seem to be focussing on features that are going to hurt the game while ignoring major issues, and major missing features.",1575335341,1,1575331741.0

They could have easily sell those modes behind some kind of subscription and people would really buy but they didn't do it. And since the characters are well known by the community they just use their familiarities to build more (I think free) spinoffs for those who would like something different than the MobA genre.

As a player I admire them for doing it for free and basically just sticking with the cosmetics only income they have and not milking the playerbase and we all know that they could do it just fine and have people pay for everything.

that's what I hate about modern esports.

The moment the company stops pumping in money because after years and years they don't get a penny back, is the moment the whole esports scene dies. I mean that's pretty much what happened to Heroes of the Storm. Blizzard stopped throwing money into that pit  and hots esports stopped existing. Heck for most people hots in general stopped existing, as if a casual audience can't exist without an esports scene...",1574669894,1,1574666294.0
25,mirracz,"1) Skyrim

Skyrim is a game that defined this decade. Many of other popular games are popular because they've built upon Skyrim. It's also a game with largest cultural impact of this decade. It's a game which transcended gaming. Many poeple have Skyrim as their only game. Many non gamers recognise Skyrim theme... That is something that the fancy Witchers or Red Deads never did.

2) Borderlands 2

My top game of all time. The shooting is great, weapon variety is amazing, builds are cool. This game has so many varied enemies so the fighting never gets boring. On addition to all that, Handsome Jack is the best villian of any game and overall the story of the game is engaging. And the humor is amazing. Everything except for UVHM is amazing. 

3) Minecraft

Similar to Skyrim, it became known outside of gaming and affected many people. It's the ultimate combination of chill-out game and creative game.

4) Fallout New Vegas

Fallout 3 doesn't fit in this decade so I put here FNV in it's place. FNV is basically a standlone expansion to F3 and many of what makes FNV great is there thanks to F3. I cannot forgive the game how buggy it was (I had to use console like 10x more than in F3) and how it wasn't even able to detect my GPU. But even with this, it's one of my top favorite games of all time. The overworld may be bland but the factions and companions make up for it. Add A World of Pain mod to make this game a complete experience.

5) Rimworld

A colony survival simulator that at the same time works as an interactive story. One of the rare games where I don't reload when losing a character, because that creates unique story. It's even better when the pawn doesn't die but is permanently damaged (like a missing eye), because then I can spend my efforts to try to find a cure/prosthetic for that pawn. The game is simply amazing, full of amazing storis that we create...

6) X-Com 2

Amazing tactical game with so much variety. Also, the combat is quite cinematic and enjoyable as hell. It simply feels good to fight the aliens in this game.

7) Fallout 4
A great game. A great Fallout game. A somewhat lacking RPG. Despite some diminished RPG elements the game still plays great. The typical Fallout exploration is amazing and satisfying. And then the settlement building makes up for any missing mechanics. With Sim Settlements, this game is a blast to play, but even the base game is great.

8) Tales from the Borderlands

I've never thought I'd love a Telltale game so much but Tales proved me wrong. This game isn't a looter shooter but it still is a Borderlands game. The characters are great and done in the exact Borderlands fashion.

9) Diablo 3 + Reaper of Souls 

Base Diablo 3 was okay. But with RoS and loot 2.0 the game became a blast to play. The game plays so fluidly and responsively... Something that other ARPGs haven't managed so far. The ability to experiment with builds is also great, so that we don't have to create new characters to try new builds. 

10) Stellaris

This game has something that I cannot exaxtly describe. Something that makes me create a new empire every now and then. Something like an RPG aspect. It sounds strange, but I tend to RP my empires and the experience of doing so is really great.

**Terraria** - Easily one of my favourite games of all time. I can't speak for the single player experience but I've never had a unpleasant time once I've grabbed a group of friends in. Just the inital gameplay loop and progression is insanely satisfying with many of the bosses striking that perfect balance of being challenging but not frustrating. Without the free updates the developers provided over the decade this game would of been forgettable, but the addition of hard mode and eventually the moon lord/expert mode was what changed it for me. Some of the community mods expand upon it similarly.


**Dota 2** - One of the most complex and challenging games I've ever played. The evolution of the game even from its early development as a mod to its current state is absolutely fascinating. With many of the additions and balancing decisions throughout its history being simply ingenious. The depth of the mechanics and the uniqueness of its heroes/items are unparalleled in any moba i've played and even with my countless hours I can still find niche little interactions that just amaze me. Custom games are also amazing as well as its esports scene.


**Monster Hunter World** - A lotta variety with fun mechanics baked into each weapon and enemy. Similar to Terraria in terms of combat for its gameplay loop. I just love the design of each monster and seeing it interact with its environment. It made most of the environments felt lived in as opposed to just an enemy randomly dropped in without a thought. 

**Into the Breach** - The most satisfying puzzle game I've ever played. The simplicity of its game design combined with the gorgeous detail of its HUD. One of the games i'd dare to call perfect with just how pristine every single aspect of it is.

**Enter the Gungeon** - I've played a variety of rogue lites but this was the one that hooked me. The amazing bosses combined with a huge variety of items in each run are the formula for my favourite in the genre. With the addition of Turbo and Synergies it fixed many of the issues of stale runs and allowed less conservative strategies when going for a clear.

**Divinity 2** - Hilarious interactions with an endless amount of solutions to every battle. When I see the phrase ""you can play anyway you want"" Divinity is the textbook example I think of. 

**Crosscode** - A very ambitious RPG(action adventure game?) that definitely has its shortcomings but makes up for it tenfold through its dungeons and combat system. The dungeons put me into the zone like nothing else I've experienced with the puzzles and bosses being a perfect amount of challenge for me. While I find much of the areas/quests/story reductive to the overall experience the surprising amount of depth in its combat system kept me going.

**Dark Souls 1** - Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Beautiful level design, interesting enemies and bosses with a slight sprinkle of jankiness. 

**Artifact** - Just one of the best card game experiences I've ever had. Many unique innovations on the genre with nearly every game having extremely difficult decisions that affect the outcome. Shame that it had was released with its economic issues and swiftly left to die. I've tried many TCG's but none have ever scratched the itch that Artifact did. Still praying for the long haul update.

**VA-11 HALL-A** - Not sure if I just played it at the right time of my life but I just found it really enjoyable. The music, the visual aesthetic, the dialogue. Everything just fit together perfectly and I found myself sitting with it a few hours a night fully immersing myself in the world and its characters. Thinking back on it i'm not even sure if the game itself was that good, but the memory I hold of the experience playing it was cathartic.

28,d20diceman,"My 10, in no particular order: 

**The Batman Arkham series**. I don't know if any game has made me feel as good as I do when I clear some gratuitous arcade challenge in one long flowing combo. It's made me cry more than once (the Mr Freeze DLC and the true ending). I basically want every other game to rip off it's combat. Might turn Witcher or Skyrim into games I want to finish. Above all, it's the incarnation of Batman which is closest to the composite Batman in my head, formed from all my favourite bits of the comics, the animated series and the films.  
(Arkham Asylum was 2009, but it's the one I've revisited the least anyway so I think it's fair to call this a 2010s series).  

**Project M / Project Plus**, the fan made Smash Bros game and IMO the best iteration of the series. The best combination of impossibly-high ceiling, delightfully low floor, seamless online play, a large balanced roster, and so goddamn many fun modes for casual play (""pick a character for each stock"" has become our default way to play). Contains the (pretty good) single player of Brawl, all playable with the modified/expanded roster. Looks great emulated. Development derailed in 2015 but a new team has picked it up, releasing Project Plus earlier this year. No hate for Ultimate or Melee - I'm happy to play literally any Smash game until 4am, but this is the one I'd pick if all the options are available. Probably my favourite game of all time. The only videogame I've sincerely called ""one of the crowning accomplishments of mankind"". 

Almost redundant to list **Dark Souls** here, but would be criminal to leave it off. Hundreds of hours and I barely feel like I've scratched the surface. Mainly I love the coop, playing DS2 and 3 with my partner is one of my favourite gaming memories, but I also spent a long time dueling at that bridge in DS2 and I never stopped encountering people with builds that surprised me. Also, one of my favourite things to watch on Twitch is a small streamer doing a blind first run of a Souls game. To distinguish myself from the hundreds of people who've likely already mentioned DS, I'll note that DS2 was my favourite, followed by 3, and I disliked Bloodbourne (asking me to either farm for healing potions or not have any for bosses killed it).

**The Binding Of Isaac** reignited my love of roguelikes. It's another one where I've played hundreds of hours and still feel like I have a long, long way to go (like I happened to see someone streaming it on Twitch the other day and uh... wow, ""break runs"" huh?). 


**Super Hexagon** is simple, but arguably perfect. Immensly satisfying, gets me into a deep flow state. At one point I was top 100 worldwide in it, which isn't something I've even come close to on any other game. The soundtrack is seared into my soul. If this had daily leaderboards I'd probably play it every day. I'm very rusty these days, but it's still my go-to game for long train/bus journeys - I delete my save and see if I can finish all stages before I reach my destination.   

Speaking of flow state, I have to mention **The Tetris Effect**, specifically playing it with all my HUE lights and RGB devices synced to it, under the influence of a substantial amount of marijuana. Good Lord. I just wish that it had been Lumines (the earlier tetris-like game from the same creator) which had gotten this treatment, because I've not managed to get as into Tetris as I was with Lumines, which I once played for 7 continuous hours. Oh, and would it have killed them to include Vs play? That's such a baseline feature that I didn't even check if the game had it before I purchased. I've put fewer hours into this than any other game on the list, but it was a literally fantastic experience. Can't wait to experience it in VR when I inevitably get an Index.  

It's kinda cheaty to put MtG on here, when the real appeal is the paper game, but **Magic the Gathering: Arena** has been one of my most played PC games. Feels absurdly generous after how much I struggled to get anywhere in Hearthstone - especially since they introduced duplicate protection (booster packs won't give you rare cards you already own the max number of copies for) and made it so F2P players can relatively easily get every rare-and-below card in each set as it comes out. Praise for the economy aside, the main thing is that Arena let's me play *as much Magic as I want*. 3000 games later, it turns out that's a lot of Magic! Tremendously exciting to hear that they plan to add in older cards and eventually support the Pioneer format.  

**Heroes Of The Storm** - I don't think I'll win anyone over to this one. Either you don't like MOBAs, or you've already settled on your MOBA of choice. But as someone who played enough WoW, Diablo and Starcraft for the characters to all be familiar, this is so much fun. Especially the unique characters (Abathur and The Lost Vikings being my favourites). 

**The entire AutoBattler genre**. I'm currently favouring DotA Underlords, but it's too early to call which game (UL, TeamFight Tactics, Hearthstone's new mode, or the original AutoChess) will emerge as the best one. As soon as I played the DotA 2 custom game which started this fad, I fell in love. Elements of Tower Defence, economy management, drafting, battle royale... it does a lot and the overall experience is very compelling. Makes you feel very clever when you do something risky (like pivoting to a totally different alliance mid game) and then come out on top. Duos play with my partner is even more fun. 

**Terraria**. I've bought so many gift copies of this game. My cycle is I draw in new people, the group of us start a new world, we play it obsessively for a few weeks, then people lose interest and I wait for the next people I can talk into trying it. Exploration is so much fun, advancement feels so good, and there's been so much content added for free. I probably haven't seen even half of this game.  

Honourable mentions: 
-**Dicey Dungeons** (which I haven't played long enough to be sure on yet but really seems like something special) 
-**WoW Classic** (I've made more friends playing that game than playing all the other games on this list combined) 
-**Dwarf Fortress** (alpha was available in 2006, game isn't released yet, so I'm not sure if it's too early to be a 2010s game or too late)  
-**Diablo 3** (it's excellent now but I still feel betrayed by how lacking it was at launch)",1574600924,1,1574597324.0

38,PsychoWhite19,"Well, tbh as a previous LoL player, they never advertised it as LoL 2, 3 or anything, it always had new modes especially some hardcore PvE ones where you would really really have to work with your team to win like Doom Bots or Odyssey which were like 40m stories and really enjoyable with fun gameplay. They could have easily sell those modes behind some kind of subscription and people would really buy but they didn't do it. And since the characters are well known by the community they just use their familiarities to build more (I think free) spinoffs for those who would like something different than the MobA genre.

As a player I admire them for doing it for free and basically just sticking with the cosmetics only income they have and not milking the playerbase and we all know that they could do it just fine and have people pay for everything.

43,mirracz,"1) Skyrim

Skyrim is a game that defined this decade. Many of other popular games are popular because they've built upon Skyrim. It's also a game with largest cultural impact of this decade. It's a game which transcended gaming. Many poeple have Skyrim as their only game. Many non gamers recognise Skyrim theme... That is something that the fancy Witchers or Red Deads never did.

2) Borderlands 2

My top game of all time. The shooting is great, weapon variety is amazing, builds are cool. This game has so many varied enemies so the fighting never gets boring. On addition to all that, Handsome Jack is the best villian of any game and overall the story of the game is engaging. And the humor is amazing. Everything except for UVHM is amazing. 

3) Minecraft

Similar to Skyrim, it became known outside of gaming and affected many people. It's the ultimate combination of chill-out game and creative game.

4) Fallout New Vegas

Fallout 3 doesn't fit in this decade so I put here FNV in it's place. FNV is basically a standlone expansion to F3 and many of what makes FNV great is there thanks to F3. I cannot forgive the game how buggy it was (I had to use console like 10x more than in F3) and how it wasn't even able to detect my GPU. But even with this, it's one of my top favorite games of all time. The overworld may be bland but the factions and companions make up for it. Add A World of Pain mod to make this game a complete experience.

5) Rimworld

A colony survival simulator that at the same time works as an interactive story. One of the rare games where I don't reload when losing a character, because that creates unique story. It's even better when the pawn doesn't die but is permanently damaged (like a missing eye), because then I can spend my efforts to try to find a cure/prosthetic for that pawn. The game is simply amazing, full of amazing storis that we create...

6) X-Com 2

Amazing tactical game with so much variety. Also, the combat is quite cinematic and enjoyable as hell. It simply feels good to fight the aliens in this game.

7) Fallout 4
A great game. A great Fallout game. A somewhat lacking RPG. Despite some diminished RPG elements the game still plays great. The typical Fallout exploration is amazing and satisfying. And then the settlement building makes up for any missing mechanics. With Sim Settlements, this game is a blast to play, but even the base game is great.

8) Tales from the Borderlands

I've never thought I'd love a Telltale game so much but Tales proved me wrong. This game isn't a looter shooter but it still is a Borderlands game. The characters are great and done in the exact Borderlands fashion.

9) Diablo 3 + Reaper of Souls 

Base Diablo 3 was okay. But with RoS and loot 2.0 the game became a blast to play. The game plays so fluidly and responsively... Something that other ARPGs haven't managed so far. The ability to experiment with builds is also great, so that we don't have to create new characters to try new builds. 

10) Stellaris

This game has something that I cannot exaxtly describe. Something that makes me create a new empire every now and then. Something like an RPG aspect. It sounds strange, but I tend to RP my empires and the experience of doing so is really great.

45,d20diceman,"My 10, in no particular order: 

**The Batman Arkham series**. I don't know if any game has made me feel as good as I do when I clear some gratuitous arcade challenge in one long flowing combo. It's made me cry more than once (the Mr Freeze DLC and the true ending). I basically want every other game to rip off it's combat. Might turn Witcher or Skyrim into games I want to finish. Above all, it's the incarnation of Batman which is closest to the composite Batman in my head, formed from all my favourite bits of the comics, the animated series and the films.  
(Arkham Asylum was 2009, but it's the one I've revisited the least anyway so I think it's fair to call this a 2010s series).  

**Project M / Project Plus**, the fan made Smash Bros game and IMO the best iteration of the series. The best combination of impossibly-high ceiling, delightfully low floor, seamless online play, a large balanced roster, and so goddamn many fun modes for casual play (""pick a character for each stock"" has become our default way to play). Contains the (pretty good) single player of Brawl, all playable with the modified/expanded roster. Looks great emulated. Development derailed in 2015 but a new team has picked it up, releasing Project Plus earlier this year. No hate for Ultimate or Melee - I'm happy to play literally any Smash game until 4am, but this is the one I'd pick if all the options are available. Probably my favourite game of all time. The only videogame I've sincerely called ""one of the crowning accomplishments of mankind"". 

Almost redundant to list **Dark Souls** here, but would be criminal to leave it off. Hundreds of hours and I barely feel like I've scratched the surface. Mainly I love the coop, playing DS2 and 3 with my partner is one of my favourite gaming memories, but I also spent a long time dueling at that bridge in DS2 and I never stopped encountering people with builds that surprised me. Also, one of my favourite things to watch on Twitch is a small streamer doing a blind first run of a Souls game. To distinguish myself from the hundreds of people who've likely already mentioned DS, I'll note that DS2 was my favourite, followed by 3, and I disliked Bloodbourne (asking me to either farm for healing potions or not have any for bosses killed it).

**The Binding Of Isaac** reignited my love of roguelikes. It's another one where I've played hundreds of hours and still feel like I have a long, long way to go (like I happened to see someone streaming it on Twitch the other day and uh... wow, ""break runs"" huh?). 


**Super Hexagon** is simple, but arguably perfect. Immensly satisfying, gets me into a deep flow state. At one point I was top 100 worldwide in it, which isn't something I've even come close to on any other game. The soundtrack is seared into my soul. If this had daily leaderboards I'd probably play it every day. I'm very rusty these days, but it's still my go-to game for long train/bus journeys - I delete my save and see if I can finish all stages before I reach my destination.   

Speaking of flow state, I have to mention **The Tetris Effect**, specifically playing it with all my HUE lights and RGB devices synced to it, under the influence of a substantial amount of marijuana. Good Lord. I just wish that it had been Lumines (the earlier tetris-like game from the same creator) which had gotten this treatment, because I've not managed to get as into Tetris as I was with Lumines, which I once played for 7 continuous hours. Oh, and would it have killed them to include Vs play? That's such a baseline feature that I didn't even check if the game had it before I purchased. I've put fewer hours into this than any other game on the list, but it was a literally fantastic experience. Can't wait to experience it in VR when I inevitably get an Index.  

It's kinda cheaty to put MtG on here, when the real appeal is the paper game, but **Magic the Gathering: Arena** has been one of my most played PC games. Feels absurdly generous after how much I struggled to get anywhere in Hearthstone - especially since they introduced duplicate protection (booster packs won't give you rare cards you already own the max number of copies for) and made it so F2P players can relatively easily get every rare-and-below card in each set as it comes out. Praise for the economy aside, the main thing is that Arena let's me play *as much Magic as I want*. 3000 games later, it turns out that's a lot of Magic! Tremendously exciting to hear that they plan to add in older cards and eventually support the Pioneer format.  

**Heroes Of The Storm** - I don't think I'll win anyone over to this one. Either you don't like MOBAs, or you've already settled on your MOBA of choice. But as someone who played enough WoW, Diablo and Starcraft for the characters to all be familiar, this is so much fun. Especially the unique characters (Abathur and The Lost Vikings being my favourites). 

**The entire AutoBattler genre**. I'm currently favouring DotA Underlords, but it's too early to call which game (UL, TeamFight Tactics, Hearthstone's new mode, or the original AutoChess) will emerge as the best one. As soon as I played the DotA 2 custom game which started this fad, I fell in love. Elements of Tower Defence, economy management, drafting, battle royale... it does a lot and the overall experience is very compelling. Makes you feel very clever when you do something risky (like pivoting to a totally different alliance mid game) and then come out on top. Duos play with my partner is even more fun. 

**Terraria**. I've bought so many gift copies of this game. My cycle is I draw in new people, the group of us start a new world, we play it obsessively for a few weeks, then people lose interest and I wait for the next people I can talk into trying it. Exploration is so much fun, advancement feels so good, and there's been so much content added for free. I probably haven't seen even half of this game.  

Honourable mentions: 
-**Dicey Dungeons** (which I haven't played long enough to be sure on yet but really seems like something special) 
-**WoW Classic** (I've made more friends playing that game than playing all the other games on this list combined) 
-**Dwarf Fortress** (alpha was available in 2006, game isn't released yet, so I'm not sure if it's too early to be a 2010s game or too late)  
-**Diablo 3** (it's excellent now but I still feel betrayed by how lacking it was at launch)",1574600924,1,1574597324.0

2,culturedrobot,"I mean, at the end of the day, Tim Sweeney still owns the controlling stake in Epic Games. Tencent isn't about to make Epic do something Epic doesn't already want to do, even with a 40% share.

The problem is less the stake that Tencent has in these companies and more what companies want to do in regards to China. If these game publishers and tech companies are looking at China as a vast untapped market - and they are - they will make concessions for China on their own, with no influence from Chinese companies needed.

It's going to be hard for those of us in the west to convince them otherwise as well. There's 325 million people in the US and ~740 million people in Europe (counting Russia). There's 1.4 billion people in China. That's hard for companies with something to sell to ignore, and those population numbers make it easy for them to weather the storm of outrage from people in the west while not really changing anything. 

Even Blizzard, which got a ton of heat for its decisions regarding Hearthstone, didn't actually do anything. J. Allen Brack got up on stage at Blizzcon and ""apologized"" without even mentioning the controversy directly and without actually promising to do anything different.

I've been playing almost daily for the past two years, after taking a break for a year before that.

I didn't play as much as I did when I first started (no-lifed the hell out of it), but it was still regular play.  And it was always scheduled, I had to start around noon local time because that's when the Sorties (daily missions for mostly unique rewards) rotated.  I farmed out every new Prime Access gear, the new weapons/frames, etc without too much delay.  

I was moderately hyped for the new content they showed during Tennocon in July, but with the release of the Liches (layers upon layers of RNG for one of 13 weapons that also has an RNG stat component to it) and the devstream of their Empyrean gameplay (Space Combat 2.0), that all kind of dried up.  And then I heard the parts for Empyrean had RNG stats too, so even better.  

I started to ask myself why I was doing things.  Why do the Sorties if I don't need any more pineapples to never melt, or Rivens to sell to further grow my plat stocks that I never use?  Why do Nightwave when I never use the Umbra Forma awarded at the final rank and don't need any of the rewards in the credits shop?  Why bother with this new gear dropping to increase my Mastery Rank despite there being no major benefit at the point I'm at?  Why bother with Liches and Railjack when the content of both look to be unfun, in a game where I honestly have fun very rarely?  

It's been ten days now, and I was originally going to quit at the end of the year but moved up my plans after seeing how the game's gonna go from now on (crystal ball don't fail me now!).  It's been a little longer since I quit Kingdom of Loathing, but I can sum that up in fewer than three paragraphs:  Playing normally simply took too much real time, and using a popular botting program took too many system resources to the point where I couldn't play any 'heavy' games past emulated titles...and this still took quite a bit of real time.  All I have left is Heroes of the Storm, and at least I still kind of have fun with it...but then I play it 'wrong' (VS AI Coop only) and I'm really only there to clear dailies and do the seasonal events for cosmetics that, again, I don't really see a use for, so it may not last longer either.  And that's another case of ""the game humbly requests you play this way instead of doing whatever you like or you just don't get these extra rewards"" too...

8,Clbull,"Not surprised that OWL is going downhill. Activision Blizzard are dire when it comes to esports and it's their corporate greed, licensing restrictions and heavy royalties that is killing the viability of competitive gaming in general.

I used to be a big fan of professional Starcraft 2. The scene was a huge circuit of major privately-hosted tournaments between 2011 and 2012, being eclipsed only by League of Legends in the latter half of 2012.

But when Riot launched LCS in 2013, Blizzard sought to emulate their strategy, consolidate the entire scene into their own centralised league and delivering the same free HD broadcast promise that Riot made, without any understanding whatsoever of why a centralised publisher-owned esports league would work for Riot (free marketing for a F2P microtransaction business model) and not for Blizzard (full priced game with full priced expansion packs.)

The resulting league, WCS, was an absolute shitshow. Every stakeholder involved was given little to no warning of the league's imminent launch, so you had ESL (Europe), GOMTV (Korea), Ongamenet (Korea) and MLG (America) scrambling to host qualifiers for just three regions, flipping the middle finger to Latin America, SEA and China. MLG ran Season 1 of WCS America 2013 so badly and had so many of their own resources crippled by Blizzard's changes to their business model that they backed down from hosting professional Starcraft tournaments entirely after just the first season, leaving NASL to pick up the pieces.

The North American Star League (NASL) had it even worse. With WCS America, Europe and Korea contracts taken up by competitors and hogging all the airtime, a Blizzard-enforced broadcasting embargo effectively cockblocked NASL from continuing to host their own league. This forced them to take a bargain bin side gig casting the World of Tanks WGL instead. This along with related financial troubles and the sheer expense of hosting WCS America in later seasons led to the company's bankruptcy in late 2013.

Ongamenet on the other hand were so frustrated by Starcraft 2's failure in Korea that they too bowed out of the scene after the second season. Kespa would follow suit just three years later along with nearly all of the Korean teams that had big national &amp; international sponsors.

The only stakeholders who thrived in the WCS system were ESL and Dreamhack.

Then there's the region locking, or lack thereof (until 2016 anyway.) You couldn't compete in multiple WCS regions at once but there was nothing stopping you from competing in another region without already being a resident. No non-Korean player won a WCS season that year, or in 2014 for that matter thanks to the lack of region locking. The closest we had to a foreigner victory was Stephano reaching the season 1 finals of WCS Europe 2013 and losing quite convincingly to Mvp. Since then it was entirely all-Korean finals. Every single qualifier spot in America was taken up by Code B Korean players who couldn't break GSL, to the point where WCS America became WCS Korea 2. The only reason Europe didn't become WCS Korea 3 was because of the sheer latency difference between Korea and Europe in the online qualifiers which at least gave Europeans the chance to compete.

Now, the playing field is more equal with foreigners not just qualifying but also winning certain Korean tournaments. It's not certain whether Europe and America got good or if the Korean scene imploded so much that its players became bad.

And don't even get me started on how badly Blizzard screwed over the Heroes of the Storm community either...

The sad reality is that OWL is a massive esports bubble waiting to burst. And when it does, there's no way that big investors like Kraft, Bilibili, Aquilini, Huya, Nenking Group, Comcast, etc are going to trust another esports startup. It's like Blizzard sank lots of money into OWL expecting Superbowl levels of viewership without understanding how to monetise spectator sports.",1578513353,1,1578509753.0

Another game which has this exact same phenomenon is Heroes of the Storm... also made by Blizzard.

Thing is, I think MOBAs are designed that way. Unlike Overwatch or so, where rounds are brief and mistakes hence at most waste 10 or so minutes, even Heroes has 20-30 minutes rounds, and like any MOBA it escalates mistakes, trying to make whoever is already ahead pull ahead even further. This keeps playtimes somewhat in check but makes for easy rage targets as someone making a crucial mistake **will** probably cost you the game, despite it just being 20 seconds of a 25 minutes round.",1578423292,1,1578419692.0

&amp;#x200B;

1. Yakuza 0 - I bought this game on whim since I was looking for a game similar to Sleeping Dogs. I never would've expected it to be one of the greatest games I've ever played. Both of the playable characters have such great stories and both have amazing boss fights. Even the side characters are interesting like Nishiki and Kuze. It also has my favorite mini-game which is the Cabaret Club. I'm currently playing Yakuza Kiwami 2 and so far it's stacking up nicely with 0. 
2. Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut- I put the DC instead of the original because of its seamless transition to the DLC story *Missing Link.* It also fixes the boss fights since in the original version their was no option to beat them non-lethally. It added more environmental options to defeating them. Other than that, I just loved the atmosphere this game had and it had great characters. Mankind Divided would've been on this list too if it didn't have such an abrupt ending to its main story. 
3. Overwatch- I've been playing on and off since release and while I've had plenty of moments where I swore off this game I eventually keep on coming back. I believe it's accessibility is its biggest strength. It's very easy for a beginner to get into it due to the simplicity of some of the heroes like and I realized that some of their backgrounds attract certain players.  At the end of the day while this game can tilt me to no end I absolutely enjoy playing it (as long as I'm not playing main tank). 
4. Mass Effect 3- Mass Effect 3 is superior to 2 for only one reason. Multiplayer. While the grind to unlock was absolutely bullshit; example being I didn't have some good weapons after over 100 hours of playing. In the end, I just installed a cheat engine to give me a bunch of points. It was 2 years after the last update so I wasn't going to get banned. Besides that, it simply never got old. I had a lot of ways to play whether it be sniping in the back with a Geth Infiltrator or playing in your face with a Batarian Brawler Vanguard. 
5. Batman Arkham City- This is the best overall Arkham game for me. I honestly don't have much to add here I just remember enjoying it more than others. 
6. Red Orchestra 2/ Rising Storm - This game is the perfect in between for those that like shooters like Battlefield and Squad. I've always been a sucker for WW2 games since my first FPS was a WW2 shooter (COD Big Red One). While this game is kind of rough around the edge it's one of the few games where I was totally immersed. I have fond memories holding off attacks on Guadalcanal, burning Banzai charges, ambushing Germans on Bridges, and mowing down Germans with my PPSH. The only thing is these type of games bring out the racists. It can get annoying trying to have fun playing this game when you have Wehraboos who only playing Germany start going on about how Hitler wasn't a bad guy. 
7. Fallout New Vegas- I've beaten this game four times, one for each ending. It's a buggy mess at times, but the writing and the mods made it enjoyable. I was disappointed with Fallout 4, since I felt like I didn't have as much skill checks and other traits that made New Vegas enjoyable. 
8. Skyrim- Best played during winter. Besides that, I liked it for the mods and the world. It's always more fun for me to just pick a direction and just travel. Enjoying the scenery and enjoying the random encounters. 
9. Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pain - For me, this game has the greatest intro of any game that I've played. To put it bluntly after playing the intro the game had me by my balls. I just couldn't put it down. I enjoyed its gameplay elements like weapon handling, and movement. Also, from the intro to  \*\*Spoiler:\*\* &gt;!The Death of Skull Face !&lt;  is one of my favorite video game experiences ever. Just ignore what happens after.
10. Divinity Original Sin 2- I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did. I was apprehensive to its turn based combat but as I got better I saw how deep it was. It was challenging for me, I rebuilt my character builds multiple times because I was lacking damage or I simply didn't like the composition. The characters also felt like individuals with their own motives. It's hard for me to put into their words, but to me they felt real and flawed.

the difference is night and day for me, having played a lot of Activision-Blizzard lootbox games. i played Heroes of the Storm when it was direct purchase, then saw what Overwatch style lootboxes did, then saw them shift HotS to 2.0 with OW style lootboxes. those Activision RNG based spending caps are just way worse and greedier of a system than the worst of Eververse.

In the end, I just installed a cheat engine to give me a bunch of points. It was 2 years after the last update so I wasn't going to get banned. Besides that, it simply never got old. I had a lot of ways to play whether it be sniping in the back with a Geth Infiltrator or playing in your face with a Batarian Brawler Vanguard. 
5. Batman Arkham City- This is the best overall Arkham game for me. I honestly don't have much to add here I just remember enjoying it more than others. 
6. Red Orchestra 2/ Rising Storm - This game is the perfect in between for those that like shooters like Battlefield and Squad. I've always been a sucker for WW2 games since my first FPS was a WW2 shooter (COD Big Red One). While this game is kind of rough around the edge it's one of the few games where I was totally immersed. I have fond memories holding off attacks on Guadalcanal, burning Banzai charges, ambushing Germans on Bridges, and mowing down Germans with my PPSH. The only thing is these type of games bring out the racists. It can get annoying trying to have fun playing this game when you have Wehraboos who only playing Germany start going on about how Hitler wasn't a bad guy. 
7. Fallout New Vegas- I've beaten this game four times, one for each ending. It's a buggy mess at times, but the writing and the mods made it enjoyable. I was disappointed with Fallout 4, since I felt like I didn't have as much skill checks and other traits that made New Vegas enjoyable. 
8. Skyrim- Best played during winter. Besides that, I liked it for the mods and the world. It's always more fun for me to just pick a direction and just travel. Enjoying the scenery and enjoying the random encounters. 
9. Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pain - For me, this game has the greatest intro of any game that I've played. To put it bluntly after playing the intro the game had me by my balls. I just couldn't put it down. I enjoyed its gameplay elements like weapon handling, and movement. Also, from the intro to  \*\*Spoiler:\*\* &gt;!The Death of Skull Face !&lt;  is one of my favorite video game experiences ever. Just ignore what happens after.
10. Divinity Original Sin 2- I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did. I was apprehensive to its turn based combat but as I got better I saw how deep it was. It was challenging for me, I rebuilt my character builds multiple times because I was lacking damage or I simply didn't like the composition. The characters also felt like individuals with their own motives. It's hard for me to put into their words, but to me they felt real and flawed.

I was moderately hyped for the new content they showed during Tennocon in July, but with the release of the Liches (layers upon layers of RNG for one of 13 weapons that also has an RNG stat component to it) and the devstream of their Empyrean gameplay (Space Combat 2.0), that all kind of dried up.  And then I heard the parts for Empyrean had RNG stats too, so even better.  

I started to ask myself why I was doing things.  Why do the Sorties if I don't need any more pineapples to never melt, or Rivens to sell to further grow my plat stocks that I never use?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Yakuza 0 - I bought this game on whim since I was looking for a game similar to Sleeping Dogs. I never would've expected it to be one of the greatest games I've ever played. Both of the playable characters have such great stories and both have amazing boss fights. Even the side characters are interesting like Nishiki and Kuze. It also has my favorite mini-game which is the Cabaret Club. I'm currently playing Yakuza Kiwami 2 and so far it's stacking up nicely with 0. 
2. Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut- I put the DC instead of the original because of its seamless transition to the DLC story *Missing Link.* It also fixes the boss fights since in the original version their was no option to beat them non-lethally. It added more environmental options to defeating them. Other than that, I just loved the atmosphere this game had and it had great characters. Mankind Divided would've been on this list too if it didn't have such an abrupt ending to its main story. 
3. Overwatch- I've been playing on and off since release and while I've had plenty of moments where I swore off this game I eventually keep on coming back. I believe it's accessibility is its biggest strength. It's very easy for a beginner to get into it due to the simplicity of some of the heroes like and I realized that some of their backgrounds attract certain players.  At the end of the day while this game can tilt me to no end I absolutely enjoy playing it (as long as I'm not playing main tank). 
4. Mass Effect 3- Mass Effect 3 is superior to 2 for only one reason. Multiplayer.

I'm not sure how much worse it can get, short of Blizzard going completely under, which is unlikely.   


Heroes of the Storm is in a sunset phase. Hearthstone and World of Warcraft are coasting on cruise control with no real innovation or inspiration; WoW Classic gave WoW a shot in the arm but I hear absolutely NO hype or interest from folks about the upcoming expansion -- WoD and BFA have caused too much long term damage to the reputation of the game. Overwatch 2's announcement fizzled quickly after it was announced when it was discovered they have no earthly clue when it's going to come out and it's really just a glorified DLC with improved visuals and single player component. W3: Reforged is crashing and burning before our very eyes.   


Diablo 4 hype might carry them a while. But the internet was divided when D4 was shown at Blizzcon due to a number of reasons including the always online requirement and the Warlords of Draenor-esque ""public events"".  


This certainly isn't Blizzard of old. I know it's naive to expect them to be, but I remember when Blizzard's ""when it's done™"" philosophy ruled the day and carried the company to quality, profitable, products. Now it feels like they're rushing things out, contracting things out, and generally chasing trends more than setting them.",1580401908,1,1580398308.0

I would've been happy to buy Reforged if it were just the same game with some improved lighting, same models with some extra polygons, same textures just upscaled and cleaned up, same goofy looking animations, same audio just remastered at a higher bitrate, etc...  
Unfortunately they tried to do a lot more than that, [outsourced the art](https://www.lemonskystudios.com/project-timeline/) to a third-party eastern studio with a different style, and seemingly ended up having to rush things at the end and cut a lot of what they originally showed/promised.",1580350744,1,1580347144.0

5,Mister_Yi,"Yeah it's obvious they didn't take MOBAs seriously until way too late and I remember reading in an interview somewhere kind of recently about that being one of their biggest regrets. I think it was Mike Morhaime talking about his time at Blizzard.

LoL launched back in 2009 and it wasn't until 2013 when Blizzard announced they were working on their own version called Blizzard All-stars (which was just a custom SC2 map made by Blizzard). By this point LoL is 4 years old and growing like wildfire and DOTA 2 had just been released. Blizzard realizes this MOBA thing is huge and only getting bigger so they finally give the go-ahead and funding to spin Blizzard All-stars off into a standalone game, Heroes of the Storm, which is really just a standalone SC2 custom game.

So they're already late to the party and, likely in an effort to get a product to market immediately and start making money, they push out the product they have, which is a SC2 custom map that's competing with 2 standalone hand-crafted games, 1 of which being the true successor to arguably the original game that started the genre.

Chances are we would have ended up with something entirely different if they picked up on the trend during early DOTA days, especially considering the DOTA craze predates SC2 by several years.",1580332189,1,1580328589.0
6,PontiffPope,"In general, I always try to start with option (A), as I wishes to going in blind and approach a new game's story, lore and characters based on my first impressions.

After I've finished the game, it can actually be of great interest to look on the game's Wiki-pages or Tvtropes-pages to get an inner insight on ""behind-the-scenes""-look, essentially doing option (B). Of course, for things like RPG:s or with heavy character customization where I want the player character to be fitting in the world, some supplementary material of the world itself helps a lot to add further immersion for the game's story to envelop. [Take for instance the naming convention of the player races in the MMO Final Fantasy XIV](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/63112-Race-Naming-Conventions), which itself aids on naming my character to be as lore-friendly as possible. That FFXIV's NPC:s then actually addresses my character by their name in-game is a further plus.

I do not like, however, when critical story moments occurs in materials outside the game. [World of Warcraft is especially guilty of this, where a huge context of their current expansion, *Battle of Azeroth*, had their premise preset and described in the novel *Before the Storm*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Before_the_Storm). There's a certain disconnect when you get referred to a real-life novel when you are playing a story-rich game, and it also makes a part of the story in-game miss-able by players who haven't read the supplementary materials.

So I guess in regards to option (C): background lore and world-building is acceptable to be gained from outside game-sources; critical story or character progression, not so much.",1580744635,1,1580741035.0
7,SantiagoxDeirdre,"If anything SC2 was the start of their sins because it **didn't** focus on casual gamers.  SC2 went ""elite E-sports"" route right off the bat.  Because of that, the custom games felt like (and were) an enormous afterthought that Blizzard put almost no effort into.  They also moved away from casual modes and put a lot less emphasis on them, again pushing more ""E-Sports elite"".  

The result was a predictable mess.  The much, much later move to try and salvage custom games and add in Co-op mode was too little, too late.  SC2, if it had great custom lobbies and Co-op mode at the start would have had a much longer shelf life.  But they chased the almight E-sports dollar, and the result was a mess.

That's one of the reasons that Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm all had such a strong casual gamer focus, the internal backlash from the perceived failure of SC2 was huge.",1580749743,1,1580746143.0
8,mighty_mag,"They've completely missed the point of the original's art style. One of the things that made Warcraft 3, and WoW by extension, stand the test of time was it's art style. It didn't tried to do realistic graphics, like say, Age of Empires, but rather went with a very clearly super deformed style that added a lot of charm to the game.

Instead of keeping the same art style they've went and completely changed it. They've changed proportions, added to many fine details you can't see during gameplay but make character models muddled went looked from a distance. Muradin look goddamn awful. It's like they've stretched him for some reason. The realistic textures on things like the armour's metal doesn't really sit nice with the rest of the game, and faces and hair look like made of out of plastic.

It's kinda of ironic, but Heroes of the Storm for all it's flaws managed to capture the essence of the art style of Warcraft 3 while adding more details much, much better than WC3's own remaster.",1580788536,1,1580784936.0

13,b1bendum,"I wonder if this is a particularly Blizzard brand of hubris.  The same thing happened with Heroes of the Storm, where the game lacked bans for a completely ridiculous amount of time.  The responses from Blizzard were the same as well. 

""Bans shouldn't be needed to fix balance, we'll just balance things ourselves!"". This in particular was a big one and was particularly egregious when game design abortions like the original implementation of Tracer were dropped in the game with 0 bans available and like a 70%+ winrate. Better hope your team picks first or enjoy your 20 minute loss. 

""Match times will increase"". Again, focusing on the tree and missing the forest.  This rolled into the balance issue above, where apparently a 2-3 minute increase in draft times was unacceptable compared to wasting 20+ minutes of your time being fucking stomped by whatever character was OP (statistically, not just ""gut feel"") that week.

""Players don't need it because most aren't GMs"". Again, the crazy thing is that even if you aren't a GM you probably aren't a complete idiot either. The ban meta in lower leagues of HoTS is completely different than at upper leagues.  Maybe lower rank players aren't as mechanically gifted, etc, etc, but most aren't total dummies. Kael'thas is a terror at low ranks and merely decent at high ranks and sees tons of bans down low. Who's to say that low rank players won't use the tools to their advantage and will mindlessly ape the GM bans they see in streams? See a little hubristic to assume that at the very least.

""People want to change the meta, but it won't do that for them"". Again, absolutely not what was seen in HOTS.  You have a character like The Butcher a melee AA carry hero.  If the enemy team drafts any blinds or lockdowns he can be almost useless but if you can prevent that suddenly he becomes viable. Cho'Gall was wrecked by percent damage and superior map macro but again bans unlocked the possibility of using this character.  The meta actually became more available (at least at lower levels, the top level meta was always fairly rigid just because the players could min-max so hard) with bans, because otherwise you had so many choices available to hard counter the ""niche"" picks that you ended up just drafting a team of jack-of-all-trades team-fighters and going from there.  Bans made macro plays, carry plays, and other strategies viable.

Overall it's just really disappointing to see that Blizzard still has the ""father knows best"" paternalistic attitude towards the player base especially when this strategy has already failed in one of their other games.  Bans make up for balance failures that they will absolutely not fix quickly enough (don't believe their lies), they open up different strategies, and they are generally utilized for their intended purpose even by low rank players.

18,Tigertemprr,"I think it's problematic to attribute *that much* of a game/genre to its underlying rulesets/pedigree. By that logic, Blizzard built everything on the back of Tolkein/Warhammer/Dungeons&amp;Dragons and other RTS games (including those that had hero systems before Blizzard). Just like how that'd undermine Blizzard's contributions, it'd also undermine all the work/passion these MODDERS put into FREE custom games. 

Blizzard certainly gets credit for making wonderful RTS games with systems/tools made available to the community (hero system, jungling, map editor, custom games, Bnet, etc). Credit ends there. They did not make Aeon of Strife for StarCraft. They did not make Defense of the Ancients or Tides of Blood. They didn't patch/iterate/develop each of those games for years either. They *certainly* didn't have anything to do with all the additional assets/systems/features/engines built by other companies to further the genre. How much credit does Unreal need for every game made with their engine? Valve for Garry's mod and AutoChess? Dice for Project Reality? ArmA for the entire battle royale genre? IMO, everything you're claiming as a ""foundation"" is flimsy on close inspection.

I loved Blizzard, they'll always be fondly remembered as the makers of some of my favorite games, but I don't think it's ""nonsensical"" to criticize/mock how they mistakenly sat on a popular game made within their own game. I don't think it's ""nonsensical"" to give the majority of credit to the modders who actually made the games. Other companies realized DotA's potential and they acted on it LEGALLY.

19,Gc8211,"&gt; and Blizzard said the ""Technology isn't there yet"" for LAN. 


This quote was more about the inability to rejoin a game after being disconnected. To some extent its partially true. The way Blizzard architected their RTS games didnt making reconnecting that viable. The architect focused on just sending player commands and then the client would interpret the player commands to build the correct game output. It's an oldschool technique to improve performance of multiplayer. It reduced the amount of data that was required to be sent. This was a big deal in the 90s and early 2000s and was the reason why Blizzard RTS games bad superior performance compared to their competitors like Westwood. Even going into the mid 2000s this was still the preferred method of design which is why Blizzard went with it. Unfortunately, by the time Blizzard released SC2 internet speed and performance greatly improved and you didnt need to rely on performance tricks as much.



However, even with that architecture you can still create methods to reconnect. For eSports they built in a save feature that would allow people to save the game after disconnect and then restart the match with the saved game.


A feature that was added to Heroes of the Storm was an actual reconnect but man did that suck. Where as with DOTA you can reconnect in about 5 to 10 seconds. With HOTS the entire game match has to be simulated so you can catch up to the other players. So basically you reconnect, the server sends you a replay, your game tries to run that replay at like 10x the speed and eventually you catch up to reconnect. This process can be really painful and slow. Were talking a minute to reconnect.



Where LAN comes into play is that with LAN the likelyhood of being disconnected drops significantly because you have less variables.",1580310821,1,1580307221.0

&gt; 21. In addition to the foregoing, in or about October 2004, two Warcraft fans, Steve Feak (who also participated in the development of the DotA mods) and Steve Mescon, launched the Internet website DotA-Allstars.com (www.dota-allstars.com) (the ""DotA-Allstars Website""). The DotA-Allstars Website was a website dedicated to promoting, advertising and distributing the DotA Mods. The DotA-Allstars website was visited by millions of people, and at one time the average number of visitors to the website exceeded one million each month. Via the DotA-Allstars Website, Feak and Mescon distributed versions of the DotA Mods, communicated with members of the public concerning the DotA Mods, advertised upcoming DotA tournaments and competitions, and collected fan artwork concerning the DotA Mods. All of these activities were undertaken with the authorization and consent of Blizzard, pursuant to the EULA. In 2008, Feak and Mescon each assigned all of their rights in and to the DotA Mods and the DotA-Allstars Website to ""DotA-Allstars,  LC."" In 2010, DotA-Allstars, LLC was purchased by Riot Games, Inc. In 2011, Riot transferred DotA-Allstars, LLC to Blizzard. Accordingly, Blizzard now possesses all rights that DotA-Allstars LLC may have had in connection with the DotA Mods and the DotA-Allstars website, including any trademarks or other goodwill DotA-Allstars LLC may have had in the DOTA Marks.

Steve Feak = ""Guinsoo"", Steve Mescon = ""Pendragon""

The net result of the trademark dispute was that [Valve could use ""DOTA"" commercially, and Blizzard could use it non-commercially](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-11-blizzard-and-valve-settle-dota-trademark-disagreement).

Gamers were asking for official Blizzard DotA for a long time. They sat on a massively popular custom game for like 10 years while other companies took notice and built their own.

I'm also not convinced there's even much IP to protect. Sure, stuff like ""Malfurion"" and ""Tyrande"" with similar character models is obvious, but what else is there that's essential to the game functioning? Blizzard didn't invent RTS, spell-casting, laning, item builds, the MOBA genre, etc. Modders put in a lot of time/effort to make Blizzard assets work in specific custom games, but they could've been any assets—those were just what was available in the tools.

Heroes of the Storm is in a sunset phase. Hearthstone and World of Warcraft are coasting on cruise control with no real innovation or inspiration; WoW Classic gave WoW a shot in the arm but I hear absolutely NO hype or interest from folks about the upcoming expansion -- WoD and BFA have caused too much long term damage to the reputation of the game. Overwatch 2's announcement fizzled quickly after it was announced when it was discovered they have no earthly clue when it's going to come out and it's really just a glorified DLC with improved visuals and single player component. W3: Reforged is crashing and burning before our very eyes.   


Diablo 4 hype might carry them a while. But the internet was divided when D4 was shown at Blizzcon due to a number of reasons including the always online requirement and the Warlords of Draenor-esque ""public events"".

By this point LoL is 4 years old and growing like wildfire and DOTA 2 had just been released. Blizzard realizes this MOBA thing is huge and only getting bigger so they finally give the go-ahead and funding to spin Blizzard All-stars off into a standalone game, Heroes of the Storm, which is really just a standalone SC2 custom game.

So they're already late to the party and, likely in an effort to get a product to market immediately and start making money, they push out the product they have, which is a SC2 custom map that's competing with 2 standalone hand-crafted games, 1 of which being the true successor to arguably the original game that started the genre.

After I've finished the game, it can actually be of great interest to look on the game's Wiki-pages or Tvtropes-pages to get an inner insight on ""behind-the-scenes""-look, essentially doing option (B). Of course, for things like RPG:s or with heavy character customization where I want the player character to be fitting in the world, some supplementary material of the world itself helps a lot to add further immersion for the game's story to envelop. [Take for instance the naming convention of the player races in the MMO Final Fantasy XIV](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/63112-Race-Naming-Conventions), which itself aids on naming my character to be as lore-friendly as possible. That FFXIV's NPC:s then actually addresses my character by their name in-game is a further plus.

I do not like, however, when critical story moments occurs in materials outside the game. [World of Warcraft is especially guilty of this, where a huge context of their current expansion, *Battle of Azeroth*, had their premise preset and described in the novel *Before the Storm*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Before_the_Storm). There's a certain disconnect when you get referred to a real-life novel when you are playing a story-rich game, and it also makes a part of the story in-game miss-able by players who haven't read the supplementary materials.

They also moved away from casual modes and put a lot less emphasis on them, again pushing more ""E-Sports elite"".  

The result was a predictable mess.  The much, much later move to try and salvage custom games and add in Co-op mode was too little, too late.  SC2, if it had great custom lobbies and Co-op mode at the start would have had a much longer shelf life.  But they chased the almight E-sports dollar, and the result was a mess.

""Bans shouldn't be needed to fix balance, we'll just balance things ourselves!"". This in particular was a big one and was particularly egregious when game design abortions like the original implementation of Tracer were dropped in the game with 0 bans available and like a 70%+ winrate. Better hope your team picks first or enjoy your 20 minute loss. 

""Match times will increase"". Again, focusing on the tree and missing the forest.  This rolled into the balance issue above, where apparently a 2-3 minute increase in draft times was unacceptable compared to wasting 20+ minutes of your time being fucking stomped by whatever character was OP (statistically, not just ""gut feel"") that week.

""Players don't need it because most aren't GMs"". Again, the crazy thing is that even if you aren't a GM you probably aren't a complete idiot either. The ban meta in lower leagues of HoTS is completely different than at upper leagues.  Maybe lower rank players aren't as mechanically gifted, etc, etc, but most aren't total dummies. Kael'thas is a terror at low ranks and merely decent at high ranks and sees tons of bans down low. Who's to say that low rank players won't use the tools to their advantage and will mindlessly ape the GM bans they see in streams? See a little hubristic to assume that at the very least.

""People want to change the meta, but it won't do that for them"". Again, absolutely not what was seen in HOTS.  You have a character like The Butcher a melee AA carry hero.  If the enemy team drafts any blinds or lockdowns he can be almost useless but if you can prevent that suddenly he becomes viable. Cho'Gall was wrecked by percent damage and superior map macro but again bans unlocked the possibility of using this character.  The meta actually became more available (at least at lower levels, the top level meta was always fairly rigid just because the players could min-max so hard) with bans, because otherwise you had so many choices available to hard counter the ""niche"" picks that you ended up just drafting a team of jack-of-all-trades team-fighters and going from there.  Bans made macro plays, carry plays, and other strategies viable.

Overall it's just really disappointing to see that Blizzard still has the ""father knows best"" paternalistic attitude towards the player base especially when this strategy has already failed in one of their other games.

59,Tigertemprr,"I think it's problematic to attribute *that much* of a game/genre to its underlying rulesets/pedigree. By that logic, Blizzard built everything on the back of Tolkein/Warhammer/Dungeons&amp;Dragons and other RTS games (including those that had hero systems before Blizzard). Just like how that'd undermine Blizzard's contributions, it'd also undermine all the work/passion these MODDERS put into FREE custom games. 

Blizzard certainly gets credit for making wonderful RTS games with systems/tools made available to the community (hero system, jungling, map editor, custom games, Bnet, etc). Credit ends there. They did not make Aeon of Strife for StarCraft. They did not make Defense of the Ancients or Tides of Blood. They didn't patch/iterate/develop each of those games for years either. They *certainly* didn't have anything to do with all the additional assets/systems/features/engines built by other companies to further the genre. How much credit does Unreal need for every game made with their engine? Valve for Garry's mod and AutoChess? Dice for Project Reality? ArmA for the entire battle royale genre? IMO, everything you're claiming as a ""foundation"" is flimsy on close inspection.

I loved Blizzard, they'll always be fondly remembered as the makers of some of my favorite games, but I don't think it's ""nonsensical"" to criticize/mock how they mistakenly sat on a popular game made within their own game. I don't think it's ""nonsensical"" to give the majority of credit to the modders who actually made the games. Other companies realized DotA's potential and they acted on it LEGALLY.

60,Gc8211,"&gt; and Blizzard said the ""Technology isn't there yet"" for LAN. 


This quote was more about the inability to rejoin a game after being disconnected. To some extent its partially true. The way Blizzard architected their RTS games didnt making reconnecting that viable. The architect focused on just sending player commands and then the client would interpret the player commands to build the correct game output. It's an oldschool technique to improve performance of multiplayer. It reduced the amount of data that was required to be sent. This was a big deal in the 90s and early 2000s and was the reason why Blizzard RTS games bad superior performance compared to their competitors like Westwood. Even going into the mid 2000s this was still the preferred method of design which is why Blizzard went with it. Unfortunately, by the time Blizzard released SC2 internet speed and performance greatly improved and you didnt need to rely on performance tricks as much.



However, even with that architecture you can still create methods to reconnect. For eSports they built in a save feature that would allow people to save the game after disconnect and then restart the match with the saved game.


A feature that was added to Heroes of the Storm was an actual reconnect but man did that suck. Where as with DOTA you can reconnect in about 5 to 10 seconds. With HOTS the entire game match has to be simulated so you can catch up to the other players. So basically you reconnect, the server sends you a replay, your game tries to run that replay at like 10x the speed and eventually you catch up to reconnect. This process can be really painful and slow. Were talking a minute to reconnect.



Where LAN comes into play is that with LAN the likelyhood of being disconnected drops significantly because you have less variables.",1580310821,1,1580307221.0
61,x42bn6,"When Valve attempted to trademark ""DOTA"", Blizzard filed an opposition.  [Their submission](http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91202572&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=1) contained some very interesting remarks:

&gt; 21. In addition to the foregoing, in or about October 2004, two Warcraft fans, Steve Feak (who also participated in the development of the DotA mods) and Steve Mescon, launched the Internet website DotA-Allstars.com (www.dota-allstars.com) (the ""DotA-Allstars Website""). The DotA-Allstars Website was a website dedicated to promoting, advertising and distributing the DotA Mods. The DotA-Allstars website was visited by millions of people, and at one time the average number of visitors to the website exceeded one million each month. Via the DotA-Allstars Website, Feak and Mescon distributed versions of the DotA Mods, communicated with members of the public concerning the DotA Mods, advertised upcoming DotA tournaments and competitions, and collected fan artwork concerning the DotA Mods. All of these activities were undertaken with the authorization and consent of Blizzard, pursuant to the EULA. In 2008, Feak and Mescon each assigned all of their rights in and to the DotA Mods and the DotA-Allstars Website to ""DotA-Allstars,  LC."" In 2010, DotA-Allstars, LLC was purchased by Riot Games, Inc. In 2011, Riot transferred DotA-Allstars, LLC to Blizzard. Accordingly, Blizzard now possesses all rights that DotA-Allstars LLC may have had in connection with the DotA Mods and the DotA-Allstars website, including any trademarks or other goodwill DotA-Allstars LLC may have had in the DOTA Marks.

Steve Feak = ""Guinsoo"", Steve Mescon = ""Pendragon""

The net result of the trademark dispute was that [Valve could use ""DOTA"" commercially, and Blizzard could use it non-commercially](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-11-blizzard-and-valve-settle-dota-trademark-disagreement).

1,jsilv,"&gt; It's not that the player base is too small per se, it's just that the card game genre is the opposite of ""a high tide raises all boats."" The more someone invests in a card game, the less they are willing to switch to a new game and start over. This is compounded for online card games, since you don't even own the cards and can't resell them to recoup part of the investment.

This is completely true and a little hilarious in the context of Blizzard having Heroes of the Storm going against League of Legends in the MOBA market not that long ago. It ends up being very possible we see a repeat here where the latecomer to the party just ends up with a small piece of the pie as everyone refuses to drop their current favorite for it.

The big thing Hearthstone did was take a CCG like Magic, simplify it to the point of quick and easy accessibility / play, have mobile play and then put a ton of polish on it. That was huge and hadn't been done up to that point (there were other CCG's that had done the 'Magic, but simpler!' part, but never caught on). So it made sense that it completely took over that segment of the game space. 

At this point though we have a field where if you want to play the OG, you can play Magic in a clean / reasonable client. Hearthstone still does what HS does best. Then you have a ton of tier 2/3 games to play. Legends going for the middle ground sounds like a great idea until you realize that means going back to a game with one base set and two formats to play. Yawn.

3,ColinStyles,"&gt;Can you elaborate?

Sure.  I'll start with classes as that's obvious. Sts has 4, NotFM has 8.

--

The archetypes thing is basically how many different distinct builds can you go with any one class.  For instance, on silent, poison is an archetype.  There are a few flavours of it (applied with non-blocked attacks, doubling, noxious fumes), but they all include poison as their win condition.  Silent also has shivs as an archetype.  They also have Storm (playing as many cards in a turn as possible), and strength stacking attacks.  But this really doesn't have much support and is pretty reliant on getting a few relics or events to trigger, so I'd not really consider it one.

So in total, silent has around 3-4 archetypes.

In Night of the full moon, the knight class has the following archetypes:

* Equipment stacking (basically enchantments/powers)
* Block stacking
* Life loss
* Lifegain/damage based on life
* Attack based storm

So 5 or so archetypes.  None of these are reliant on artifacts/relics, and all of them have significant support in the card pool.

And this doesn't get into the little things that can distinguish builds in each archetype, like the fact that you could get a few cards that steal cards from your opponent, or fill their deck with duds, etc.

--

As far as mechanics, Slay the spire suffers in three key ways compared to NotFM to me.  

1) Lack of enemy interaction:
Basically whatever an enemy does there is next to no way to prevent that, or adjust it.  You can't stun enemies, only one class has any meaningful ability to debuff enemies attack in a way that doesn't require blocking (silent with malaise and/or screeching cry).  You can't stop an enemy from debuffing you outside of extremely limited artifact buffs, or from buffing themselves.

2) Lack of interesting enemy abilities or turns:
They nearly always say exactly what they will do.  Makes planning fully deterministic, which removes any suspense as to whether you can handle or not handle the turn.  You'll know the moment you draw your hand whether you have any outs or are fine, or are SoL.

Enemies only do 1 thing a turn.  That fundamentally is really important as you only ever have to deal with a single thing every turn, rather than working out the odds of the enemy getting a debuff and a nut draw to explode you, or maybe drawing all those duds you through in there so you can deal damage.  It adds variance.

Very few enemies in StS also modify your playstyle.  Only a very small subset have passives or passive-like abilities that will force you to play differently or be able to possibly even exploit the situation.  No enemy has weaknesses to X type of damage (and in fact there really isn't a concept of damage types in StS), or resistance.  Only a few will mess with your deck other than adding chaff (snecko and time eater is the only one I can think of).

3) Lack of card types / resources

You have 3 core card types on the player side.  Attack, Skill, Power.  You also have status and curse cards, but these are outliers and are never offered to you as choices.  Everything is played with energy, a single resources.

Contrast this to NotFM where you have for resources actions, mana (which may not be used at all on some classes), and every card that doesn't require any of these can always be played.

For card types you have: Attack, Action, Mana, Spell, Prayer, Counter (think hearthstone secrets), Equipment, or Special (which include things like curses or shop only results).

--

&gt;More content. I haven't played it, but I can already tell you that there's just more meat to StS. I have over 300 hours in the game doing nothing but daily runs with all of the classes available.

NoTFM has 2 entirely different game modes, which you can sort of think of as though StS not only had the spire, but also some jungle temple or something.  Basically, a whole different 3 acts.

It has hundreds of cards (each with the potential for 1-3 upgrades), dozens of 'relics' (called blessings), a hardmode that modifies your starting deck to be worse, complete with ascension mode for each class, and more I'm probably forgetting.

If you sunk 300 hours into StS, you can sink many more into NotfM.  I really _really_ loved it, and think it's a great game, let alone an exceptional mobile game.",1583260476,1,1583256876.0

I don't think they were nearly as big of a studio as they are now so it wouldn't surprise me if they allocated a lot of resources to WoW because of how big it became and thus not having a lot left for new games.

EDIT: Although maybe they're on track to do it again because if we're not counting Immortal and OW2, i don't see Diablo 4 releasing this year and with a little bit of Blizzard mismanagement it might even hit 2022 which would indeed be half a decade.",1581894933,1,1581891333.0
15,jsilv,"&gt; It's not that the player base is too small per se, it's just that the card game genre is the opposite of ""a high tide raises all boats."" The more someone invests in a card game, the less they are willing to switch to a new game and start over. This is compounded for online card games, since you don't even own the cards and can't resell them to recoup part of the investment.

This is completely true and a little hilarious in the context of Blizzard having Heroes of the Storm going against League of Legends in the MOBA market not that long ago. It ends up being very possible we see a repeat here where the latecomer to the party just ends up with a small piece of the pie as everyone refuses to drop their current favorite for it.

The big thing Hearthstone did was take a CCG like Magic, simplify it to the point of quick and easy accessibility / play, have mobile play and then put a ton of polish on it. That was huge and hadn't been done up to that point (there were other CCG's that had done the 'Magic, but simpler!' part, but never caught on). So it made sense that it completely took over that segment of the game space. 

At this point though we have a field where if you want to play the OG, you can play Magic in a clean / reasonable client. Hearthstone still does what HS does best. Then you have a ton of tier 2/3 games to play. Legends going for the middle ground sounds like a great idea until you realize that means going back to a game with one base set and two formats to play. Yawn. I actually enjoyed playing LoR, but dropped it after feeling like I had already 'seen' the game in a month.",1583182430,1,1583178830.0
16,walterdog12,"Heroes of the Storm.

At first I thought it was Blizzard's attempt at a shitty LoL/Dota knockoff and wrote it off after playing for a week or two, but I recently (like 4 months ago) started playing it again and I'm absolutely hooked and completely stopped playing LoL.",1583300923,1,1583297323.0
17,ColinStyles,"&gt;Can you elaborate?

Sure.  I'll start with classes as that's obvious. Sts has 4, NotFM has 8.

--

The archetypes thing is basically how many different distinct builds can you go with any one class.  For instance, on silent, poison is an archetype.  There are a few flavours of it (applied with non-blocked attacks, doubling, noxious fumes), but they all include poison as their win condition.  Silent also has shivs as an archetype.  They also have Storm (playing as many cards in a turn as possible), and strength stacking attacks.  But this really doesn't have much support and is pretty reliant on getting a few relics or events to trigger, so I'd not really consider it one.

So in total, silent has around 3-4 archetypes.

In Night of the full moon, the knight class has the following archetypes:

* Equipment stacking (basically enchantments/powers)
* Block stacking
* Life loss
* Lifegain/damage based on life
* Attack based storm

So 5 or so archetypes.  None of these are reliant on artifacts/relics, and all of them have significant support in the card pool.

And this doesn't get into the little things that can distinguish builds in each archetype, like the fact that you could get a few cards that steal cards from your opponent, or fill their deck with duds, etc.

--

As far as mechanics, Slay the spire suffers in three key ways compared to NotFM to me.  

1) Lack of enemy interaction:
Basically whatever an enemy does there is next to no way to prevent that, or adjust it.  You can't stun enemies, only one class has any meaningful ability to debuff enemies attack in a way that doesn't require blocking (silent with malaise and/or screeching cry).  You can't stop an enemy from debuffing you outside of extremely limited artifact buffs, or from buffing themselves.

2) Lack of interesting enemy abilities or turns:
They nearly always say exactly what they will do.  Makes planning fully deterministic, which removes any suspense as to whether you can handle or not handle the turn.  You'll know the moment you draw your hand whether you have any outs or are fine, or are SoL.

Enemies only do 1 thing a turn.  That fundamentally is really important as you only ever have to deal with a single thing every turn, rather than working out the odds of the enemy getting a debuff and a nut draw to explode you, or maybe drawing all those duds you through in there so you can deal damage.  It adds variance.

Very few enemies in StS also modify your playstyle.  Only a very small subset have passives or passive-like abilities that will force you to play differently or be able to possibly even exploit the situation.  No enemy has weaknesses to X type of damage (and in fact there really isn't a concept of damage types in StS), or resistance.  Only a few will mess with your deck other than adding chaff (snecko and time eater is the only one I can think of).

3) Lack of card types / resources

You have 3 core card types on the player side.  Attack, Skill, Power.  You also have status and curse cards, but these are outliers and are never offered to you as choices.  Everything is played with energy, a single resources.

Contrast this to NotFM where you have for resources actions, mana (which may not be used at all on some classes), and every card that doesn't require any of these can always be played.

For card types you have: Attack, Action, Mana, Spell, Prayer, Counter (think hearthstone secrets), Equipment, or Special (which include things like curses or shop only results).

--

&gt;More content. I haven't played it, but I can already tell you that there's just more meat to StS. I have over 300 hours in the game doing nothing but daily runs with all of the classes available.

NoTFM has 2 entirely different game modes, which you can sort of think of as though StS not only had the spire, but also some jungle temple or something.  Basically, a whole different 3 acts.

It has hundreds of cards (each with the potential for 1-3 upgrades), dozens of 'relics' (called blessings), a hardmode that modifies your starting deck to be worse, complete with ascension mode for each class, and more I'm probably forgetting.

If you sunk 300 hours into StS, you can sink many more into NotfM.  I really _really_ loved it, and think it's a great game, let alone an exceptional mobile game.",1583260476,1,1583256876.0

25,arnathor,"You’re right, Warcraft 3 Reforged isn’t great in its current state but it’s not worthy of the vitriol that’s being heaped on it. It’s a cumulative effect of lots of negative press surrounding Blizzard over the last couple of years (Diablo Immortal announcement, lacklustre WoW BfA expansion, Heroes of the Storm getting sidelined, streamer controversy etc.). They’ve lost a lot of goodwill and WC3R has become a focal point for that. Personally I’ve had very few issues with it in campaign mode, and I like the new graphics. Switching the client over to the same launcher style app as their other games is no small task. Their main misstep is removing the classic client from availability, which causes a big problem in the community for those who didn’t want Reforged, as it’s effectively forced on them (similar to how changes from expansion to expansion in WoW are forced on everyone, regardless of whether or not you have purchased that expansion).

26,WumFan64,"Valve used to take extra care when adding new heroes and abilities. Now, abilities are released without sounds and only added in after complaints. The effects are surprisingly ugly. Tree's roots are hideous circles. Sven aghs is his model just taped to a storm bolt.

Taped together is a great description of 2020 Dota. Anyone who has played the last decade should be able to see the decline in quality. Anyone who is starting today would never stick around to play such a mess.

You will never see an update [like this](https://youtu.be/Rj0fC5v-88Q) from Valve again; they don't care.

Also, there are tons of surprising bugs, but I guess that's nothing new. Still... if an ability or interaction is buggy, especially if the ability is new, that's forgivable imo. But shouldn't something like shift queuing be so fundamental the engine that it should be rock-solid? Why do outposts break queued orders? How can the foundation Dota is built upon be so broken?

And what does that say about Valve? Are they truly so bad at their game that they never queue orders, so never noticed the bug? Or perhaps they noticed and didn't care. Is that worse? Why am I looking to play games made by people that don't care going into 2020?

There's so much that can be said about Dota, but I'll spare you. I'd rather play a game that feels put together, not taped together.",1582700272,1,1582696672.0

3,jjp3," Overall there are some interesting parts to this video regarding marketing and launch, but the framing of the discussion as an 'autopsy' makes it so difficult to take seriously when we're talking about a game that is still so actively updated as Heroes. If this game is 'dead' then Christ, I suppose there are only six games or so left alive in the world. Nevertheless there are just so many undercooked points throughout:

&gt;*""2.0 for many fans is seen as the point where Heroes of the Storm started to deteriorate, and you can see why with the introduction of lootbox mechanics into player progression systems ...""*

He doesn't go on to elaborate on that, that is basically his point made. That keeps happening constantly from start to finish in this discussion. Speaking as a long term fan the progression system in Heroes is probably one of the most consumer friendly models there is, basically hosing you with characters and cosmetics constantly. So I don't really understand how just saying ""LOOK! lootboxes! You can see why it failed..."" constructs any sort of argument.

Moving towards Heroes post-HGC cancellation, it's very obvious he wanted to close out with 'and on yy/mm/dd, the game officially died', but was frustrated in discovering content is indeed still flowing, resulting in this jumble of a sentence where he clearly wanted to write that Deathwing would be the final hero added to the game, realised this wasn't the case, but then didn't want to have to revise his script much:

&gt;*""December 2019 would mark the last month as of March 2020 that Heroes of the Storm would get a new hero release.""*

Meanwhile, all of 2019-20, or over 25% of the game's lifespan, including Nexus Anomalies, and the constant and radical balance patches, are completely undiscussed - because they don't fit with the picture he has tried so hard to paint.

6,ruach137,"It’s very possible to win the solo lane in heroes of the storm even against skilled opponents. Far more fun for me (and more influence on the game) than brawling in the four man. Different hero matchups require different strategies to get value. 

Sometimes it means freezing the enemy wave just outside your towers so the enemy solo has to trade a lot of their health bar to soak. Sometimes it means pushing hard and taking a camp while the enemy de-pushes. 

Sometimes it means letting them push hard and pre-tapping your well (a time limited health regen tool) and hard engaging into a losing 1v1 to bait the enemy to fight until they realize you will regen 30% of your health over the next 10s. So they try to run , but this map has a longer than average distance between the two forts, and your champ gains a move speed bonus for every basic ability you use, so you can kill them only if you can land your skill shot gap closer.

Some maps have point control objectives in the solo lane, so you need to decide whether to fight in the minion wave (where some champs need to fight in the wave to sustain their health pool), or on the point and abuse vision denying bushes to draw ranged opponents into melee range.

And runeterra goes in ""steps"" but isnt cohesive or responsive, has a much clunkier playstyle and hard caps minions in an unintuitive way. The wildcard system runeterra has was directly taken from Arena. The digital part of Arena allows the game to be streamlined and prevents a significant amount of user error. Runeterra doesnt allow you to take multiple actions at once because it forces a check from the other player. Runeterra has the same tempo problem as hearthstone because the attacking player is still given priority by being able to dictate what the opponent can do since choosing to attack early can prevent any actions from your opponent. Magic Arena allows for reactions while still keeping the game flowing since it's not literally swapping turns everytime someone plays a card. Faction distinction in Runeterra is terrible since you can pop in any two factions together with no requirements. Land feeling dated means nothing honestly. Runeterra just lacks originality completely. It's incredibly inspired by magic, even pretty blatantly copying features from Arena, it uses Hearthstones mana system and even Gwent makes playing single cards at a time feel much better. Hearthstone is at the very least distinct. Runeterra has one of the most popular IPs in gaming to boost it and is barely getting more views than Heroes of the Storm, its not even top 50 on twitch right now.

2,Mathematik,"I just want to add some more context and some ideas to fix it for a pretty exhaustive list.

&gt; * The store front is a complete eyesore, they just show you every individual item all at once, rather than break it down into cosmetic categories or by hero.

There are no filters in the store front and it's just one giant page of items to scroll through with some featured / limited time items at the top.  They need to have a better sorting method with something quick and easy to see what you want and what you would get at a glance.  I have poor vision anyways, and it's not only an eyesore, but cumbersome to read.

&gt; * There's no ""lore/bio' on characters that I saw, yet one of them (the rogue looking girl) tells you her backstory over the course of 5 or 6 voice clips you only hear if you click on her over and over on the hero select screen.

There is definitely lore and information for the characters in the Collections tab off of the main menu.  As you play a character you'll unlock audio logs about the hunters as you level them up and play with them more.  The team could stand to create some in-universe trailers showing the hunters interacting with one another or fleshing out their backstories at bit in a show, don't tell fashion.

&gt; * On that note, voice work is just entirely flat and there's no personality to it or the characters besides some incredibly tired archetypes. Little cat has a normal voice. Big alien has a normal voice (and his name is Earl, ain't that hilarious!). Aquatic alien girl... normal voice.

The voice acting is hit and miss across the board.  Some of them fit, others are more generic.  Angry alien, normal alien, child robot, grizzled veteran human.  They all sound relatively alike which is difficult when in a firefight everyone sounds similar when sounding off their abilities.  Take Overwatch for example, you damn well know who said what and where when the abilities are going off.

&gt; * Going into the game itself, the initial spawn and respawn system seem so... pointless. There's about 8-10 different drop points but they're clumped together across your side of the map. Respawning takes way too long with a 20+ second death timer followed by the same animation of you going through warp onto the field.

After playing for a few hours, I've noticed that the spawns do change dynamically over the course of a match depending on which objectives are captured and where the hotspots are in combat.... kinda.  If your team is getting shitcanned, your options are limited, think kinda like the Battlefield series.  There is some retooling that needs to be done, but I don't think I can offer a better solution off the top.

&gt; * Movement speed feels sluggish, especially considering how big that map is. Movement abilities don't carry much range unless you're ""generic shooter guy"" with a straight up sprint, which wasn't even that quick either.

When in combat with other hunters, the speed seems okay, but the traversal to get to locations can be extremely tiresome.  You'll end up walking a couple minutes and end up after the party is over.  With this huge map, out of combat speed needs a buff, or maybe something like Heroes of the Storm where you can summon a mount for movement out of combat only.

&gt; * Some animations just ""snap"" to one another, and have zero flow. Jumping and shooting was the big one I noticed.

It's a nitpick, but most of the animations seem to have some lag to them.  It's much more of an issue when it comes to melee champs, the animation in comparison to the hitboxes seems off and the feedback for on-hit effects feels non-existent.  Makes playing the big tanky boys a chore and unfun.

&gt; * Weapons have no impact whatsoever and you just have to look at everyone's health slowly deplete regardless of what you're using. It's also hard to ever catch up to anyone running away, you just kinda stay at the same distance through a chase unless they try to turn and fight.

Everyone has a movement option or escape option ... kinda.  The generic soldier has a sprint button, the tanky alien has a dash, the heavy weapons alien has a rocket booster, etc etc.  However, in the experience I've had thus far, there are ways to close the distance with smart pathing, teamwork, and ability usage.  The only feedback you're going to get that you're doing something right though is either health bars dropping and hopes and prayers.  If I throw a flashbang, there is no way I know I've blinded the target.  If I hit them with a net grenade, there's no way I know I've slowed them.  They almost act the same either way.

&gt; * Hero abilities are also incredibly weak and some seem so out of place considering the setting/size of the map. Flashbangs, in a huge open alien area. A mine that's probably the size of a foot. Rogue girl's kit is a dash, and then three weapons you just swap between to reload their ammo. No character to her kit at all, and none of them packed any punch.

The grizzeld vet's flashbang would be better serviced as a blinding smoke grenade.  The rogue girl's weapons feel like grizzled veteran's weapons.  It's weird, cause I can't tell how much damage I'm really doing with them, so why bother?  Feedback is pretty bad overall.

&gt; * The map as a whole is, again, very large, and very empty. The trash mobs spawn in small group at set areas, the ones that do attack you are always alone and incredibly weak anyways. Med kits are placed in really bad spots from a level design perspective (if there's human constructs present, keep the health kits there and let the healing plants exist on the natural aspects).

Yeah, the map just needs retooling or perhaps downsizing due to the amount of people versus the amount of objectives to make.  It feels like this whole game started out as a Battle Royale and some exec decided to pivot when they saw it wasn't going to work in the same market share. 

&gt; * Secondary objectives are easy to capture and just forget about entirely. They offer bonus XP or XP gain? Not even sure. There's not much incentive to it when you can kill trash mobs just as well.

The XP is shared across the whole team, so there's definitely incentive as getting more levels boosts your overall damage output and max health on top of getting perks to your hunters.  However, the ""big bad"" called a Hive can easily be soloed with almost any character in relatively short time for thousands of XP.  I can cheese levels out of them very quickly with little counter-play available.

&gt; * The core objective, a Hive Heart, only starts to spawn *when the countdown hits zero*. It hardly even fights, just shoots bursts of homing projectiles, Make that whole lead up more lively, let it have some presence and do something to counter just sitting on top of it for five whole minutes since there's nothing else to do on that whole map.

As said above, they're very not ""raid boss"" like as the trailers implied.

&gt; * Animations for capturing objectives are just so lifeless. If there isn't much to interact with at least give them all unique animations, and make them actually touch what they're messing with.

Yeah, they just sorta stand around.  If they want to do it for the sake of simplicity, they need to have something more visible to show that an objective is being taken.  In the harvester rush mode, it doesn't even register that a objective is being captured on your hud really.

&gt; * A single fight determines the objective immediately. In fact, a single kill probably does; respawns are too unforgiving, heroes move far too slow and damage from guns and abilities just feels so insignificant.

Thats kind of how it's designed though, very League of Legends in that a big team fight will determine the next few minutes rather than it being a prolonged siege.

Another point to make is the UI sucks in-game.  They give you this detective mode button that is supposed to highlight objectives around you and give you a look at what to do next, but it barely works.  The HUD doesn't have waypoints, the map barely distinguishes you from the other units, I'll get lost constantly trying to find my tiny picture in a sea of other units.  Other units will have priority over yours, so you can't see yourself in the first place cause someone is too near you.  

The common underlying problem seems to be just lacking in the little things, the polish, the quality of life issues other games already mastered.  It's definitely an annoying experience that just isn't quite ready for primetime yet.",1590082898,1,1590079298.0
3,basketball_curry,"I dont mean any disrespect but I sincerely doubt we're anywhere close to that. Look at the buzz for diablo 4 and the mere rumor of a diablo 2 remaster. They may catch a lot of flak for a lot of things (perhaps deservedly so), but what major release have they had that truly flopped? I cant think of any other than wc3 reforged. Heroes of the storm might qualify, but that was a free to play game made on starcrafts engine by a relatively small team, and even it was fairly popular for a time. I'm not a wow guy so idk the status of their expansions, but I know they're still bringing in millions of subscribers which is absolutely insane for this day and age, particularly for a game as old as wow. Overwatch and hearthstone were and continue to be huge successes. Diablo 3 started off rocky but has rebounded considerably and continues to make them tons of money with little oversight required. The starcraft 2 expansions weren't nearly as impressive as the initial wings of liberty but they also didnt require as much development effort and still did moderately okay. Not sure how well starcraft remastered sold but again, it was a small team with a minor budget and I think it went well. 

So wc3 reforged drew a lot of ire and I'm sure didnt hit expected sales numbers, that's one game in the last decade. Most of, if not all, their other ones have done well. It's very clear that their products now are a bit dulled down for the masses and dont convey the same sense of passion and commitment like games of their pre Activision days, but by and large they're still fine products within popular franchises that many people enjoy.

7,caninehere,"&gt; Not that that'll prevent anyone from buying Diablo 4, of course.

Honestly Blizzard is the one company that has really and truly shit the bed in my eyes. I get that a lot of people spew bullcrap about companies and then buy their games anyway, but as somebody who used to be a huge Blizzard fan from like 1995-2008, I just don't care about any of their stuff anymore.

Given, I already thought Blizzard had gone downhill since the Activision merger. But I still bought all their games because why not. But Diablo III was a letdown, they let StarCraft II die off, Heroes of the Storm happened, Hearthstone just felt like them sucking money out of customers.

Overwatch felt like the tipping point to me - where clearly a lot of people like it, but it feels *really* uninspired to me personally and I guess I just realized Blizzard is a different company now with different fans. 

I *would* have bought Diablo IV because I loved the original games. But after the recent shit with Chinese censorship, with Diablo Immortal... I didn't buy Reforged, I stopped paying attention to WoW at all, and I decided I won't be buying any of their stuff in the future, Diablo IV included.

I don't feel this way about any of those other companies. I quite like Ubisoft personally, Konami decided to move in a different direction, and Take-Two can do whatever they want with GTA Online, I don't think it's hurting anybody (and I like the single player game)... and their stuff with 2K is just fine.

Bethesda I feel less warm about, but that's more just because of terrible direction in their game design that has been going downhill for like a decade now. If they came out with a new game that was really good, I'd buy it. I can't say the same for Blizzard at this point.",1590540184,1,1590536584.0
8,EmperorOfSquirrels,"I havent really followed Dota 2 balancing for a long time now, but as far as I remember, those heroes specifically are balance nightmares because of the way they work (Tinker resetting every item in the game, Techies being pretty bad but really frustrating and unfun to play against, storm spirit being hard to gank while also ganking like a monster, and natures prophet having really hard to counter splitpush).

Im sure those heroes could be balanced also, but League especially feel like they ruin heroes alot more frequently than Dota does. At least, almost all my favorite champions in League of Legends have been either ruined by straight up nerfs or ""remakes"" which basically deletes the champion and adds another one with the same name but vastly different.

I also feel like League has more of a problem with this, since League is alot more character focused. The concept of a ""main"", there arent as many hard counters in league as in Dota, so its alot more feasible to just play the same hero again and again and become really good at a few ones. In Dota, if your hero gets nerfed you can pick up the next good hero in your role.

And unfortunately developers end up bending around this. In War Thunder the game tries to match you with players of equal vehicle rating for about thirty seconds, before it just gives up and tosses you in with something way higher or lower than you. And it's because if a queue takes longer than a minute, the game is ""dead"".

Additionally, they aren't even making the game themselves. Immortal is just being offloaded to a Chinese company to make a Diablo-themed game.

Even if you are skeptical of Overwatch 2, its free content for base Overwatch 1. Shadowlands is a WoW expansion so its a hit or miss. And Diablo4 has potential, bringing back the D2 iconography and artstyle with the gameplay of D3.

And to be clear, I'm not trying to insult LoL. I played it a lot (mostly to bet someone that I could get a decent rank), but it's definitely fun. I also enjoyed (and still do) Heroes of the Storm. I think all of these games are different enough to live harmoniously at once.

I just have a hard time understanding how a LoL (or Heroes ;)) player can look at metrics like hero pick/ban rates in tournaments, and not be at least a LITTLE envious of Dota's design. Or how heroes can fit multiple roles/lanes/positions, and drafting becomes a much richer mind game (in Dota). It definitely bothered me. Things like denyng, or much stronger items in Dota are pretty small bits, which I happen to enjoy about Dota, but I think the hero design and balance philosophy are the most obvious/objective measures for why Dota is better.",1589474315,1,1589470715.0

25,Danulas,"This subreddit has a rough perception about this game. With multiplayer games, we want progression systems - either in the form of better loot like World of Warcraft or leaderboards like Rocket League. This game is kind of missing both. It has loot, but it's all purely cosmetic and it has leaderboards, but those are only for a portion of the game.

With that said, I've been playing this game fairly consistently for nearly 3 months now and I'm loving it. What's not to love about a pirate-themed sandbox? And thanks to the regular updates that this game receives, there's so much variety in what you can do. Tall Tales, voyages strictly for gold, emissaries for MORE gold, or become a Reaper's Bones emissary and start hunting down other players. Maybe you want to take on a Skeleton Fort or Armada?

Or maybe you just want to sit around and fish. That's what my crew and I have been doing this past week. Fishing and shooting the shit, just like real life but with hundreds of miles of social distancing. Even that can get interesting when you need to fish in the middle of a storm or in a battle with a skeleton ship.

**echochrome** [trailer](https://youtu.be/GybxIwfU4rI) &amp; **echochrome ii** [trailer](https://youtu.be/jUUh_1EzD0Y)

Pretty trippy downloadable-only titles where you control the perspective of the MC Escher-esque levels to get your marionette character from one end to the other. Set to a very pleasing orchestral soundtrack as well. The sequel requires a Move controller setup. 

**The Last Guy** [trailer](https://youtu.be/mYcwk0HouhU)

Overhead-style game where you control one last guy to herd all remaining survivors to safe zones in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic world.

**Yakuza: Dead Souls** [trailer](https://youtu.be/01xI7w2EdLc)

Entirely separate spinoff where it’s a survival horror zombie fuelled game set in the Yakuza universe. Recommended for completionist sake of the series

**Katamari Forever** [trailer](https://youtu.be/6FC28EwjpvU)

It’s Katamari on PS3. One of the greatest game series and comes with some excellent modes like Eternal Katamari. 

**White Knight Chronicles I &amp; II** [trailer](https://youtu.be/FIoIGmJqfPQ)

Both are cursed with mediocrity tbh, and nowadays aren’t really worth checking out solely due to its single player aspect being very subpar when compared to the multiplayer portion. In its prime, it was compared to a beefy single-player-feeling JRPG MMO (if that makes sense). But since it’s well past its prime, it’s really only worth looking into for a curiosity of a bygone time. Plus, if you can find a copy of WKC2 it comes with the first on-disc.

**House of the Dead III &amp; 4**

Really great remasters of the original arcade games and are a ton of fun. Fully playable with Move as well as 2-player support. 

**Time Crisis: Razing Storm**

Same as above, very faithful arcade version of the game with Move and multiplayer support. Even includes awesome versions of Deadstorm Pirates and Time Crisis 4!

**Class of Heroes 2G, Cross Edge, Time and Eternity, Trinity Universe, The Guided Fate Paradox, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum, Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord**

Tbh I haven’t played any of these, but they’re very overlooked JRPG’s that are exclusive to the system. 

**Child of Eden** [trailer](https://youtu.be/ZxH-HbvF01M)

This one also appeared on 360 and even received BC treatment for XBO. Having said that, it’s a very beautiful rail shooter-type game and I think is a prequel to Rez. It’s fully playable with Move controllers and that’s my preferred way of playing. I just wish I was able to try it in 3D as it is a very beautiful game. 

**Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom** [trailer](https://youtu.be/dIE3eV8HFPk)

Again, playable on 360 as well. From the devs of Folklore comes this very flawed but charming game where your character befriends and is able to control a bumbling creature called Majin and try to escape a castle. I think that’s what it is anyways, it’s been a while. I remember really enjoying my time with this one tho 

**El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron** [trailer](https://youtu.be/li0yID0-l9w)

Rounding out the overlooked only-appears-on-PS3-and-360 games comes this actual hidden gem. It’s got a great art style and really cool combat system and even has a lengthy campaign. Highly recommend if you can find a copy

Also there’s the Resistance trilogy, all Ratchet and Clanks, all Sly Coopers, MotorStorm trilogy, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Drakengard 3, Nier, Gran Turismo 5 &amp; 6, Killzone trilogy, Dead Nation, but most of these are widely popular.",1589788360,1,1589784760.0

Smite has the best and most diverse game modes, Heroes of the Storm has the iconic pop characters and maps, lol has the vast majority of different champions but its super toxic and try-hard (atleast from a casual perspective), Dota 2 i cant say much.

So if you want to go with any Moba i suggest Smite ore Heroes of the Storm, both of them are casual friendly, have a lot of iconic characters and you can have success as a casual and wont get flamed much either, contrary to Lol or Dota 2 (as far as i have heard).",1590440111,1,1590436511.0
30,Mattenth,"I never said Blizzard had zero investment in Overwatch, or that they ""abandon their franchises."" I loved the time I spent with Overwatch (probably ~100 hours). I played it both casually and competitively with multiple groups of friends. I got my $40's worth out of that game, for sure.

Having that said, I don't think it's too controversial to say that Overwatch experienced a rapidly fading competitive scene due to a lackluster meta, the lack of a meaningful progression system, and slow content updates.

Overall, Overwatch just isn't that much different from the game that launched 4 years ago. That, to me, is a lack of investment. 

Blizzard launched a pretty good game and didn't even attempt to evolve it into something great, and so it's declined.

At least Heroes of the Storm *tried* to evolve and morph and be great. I just don't see that effort on Overwatch.

And it should be *easier* for Blizzard, too. That's what really baffles me. It's not like other hero games where you buy the heroes. If there's a problem hero, just remove the hero from the game. They could have killed GOATS by just removing Reinhardt or D'va.

32,SharkyIzrod,"&gt;I don't understand why it has to beat Hearthstone or have bazilions of viewers on twitch for it to be deemed ""successful"".

People asked similar questions for WoW-killers that died, for Heroes of the Storm, for The Elder Scrolls: Legends, and so on. Hell, they said it for Artifact before the narrative shifted towards accepting its utter failure (not that any of the other games mentioned here can compare to it in terms of dropping off a cliff).

 The reality of the matter is that while it doesn't need to beat Hearthstone (or ""have bazillions of viewers"") to be successful, it needs to be up there. It needs to earn enough to be worth the opportunity cost for Riot. 

Heroes of the Storm has a playerbase most non-AAA titles would only dream of having, yet it was not successful enough for Blizzard (at least not with the large development team it had prior to 2019, maybe they're happy with it now). That's because companies of that size don't settle for distant third or far off fourth or what have you. They don't have to be *first*, but they have to be up there in contention. And that's why I think having lower average viewership than the distant second in the genre (i.e. Magic Arena) is likely not good enough for Riot's ambitions.",1591619413,-2,1591615813.0

36,Mathematik,"I just want to add some more context and some ideas to fix it for a pretty exhaustive list.

&gt; * The store front is a complete eyesore, they just show you every individual item all at once, rather than break it down into cosmetic categories or by hero.

There are no filters in the store front and it's just one giant page of items to scroll through with some featured / limited time items at the top.  They need to have a better sorting method with something quick and easy to see what you want and what you would get at a glance.  I have poor vision anyways, and it's not only an eyesore, but cumbersome to read.

&gt; * There's no ""lore/bio' on characters that I saw, yet one of them (the rogue looking girl) tells you her backstory over the course of 5 or 6 voice clips you only hear if you click on her over and over on the hero select screen.

There is definitely lore and information for the characters in the Collections tab off of the main menu.  As you play a character you'll unlock audio logs about the hunters as you level them up and play with them more.  The team could stand to create some in-universe trailers showing the hunters interacting with one another or fleshing out their backstories at bit in a show, don't tell fashion.

&gt; * On that note, voice work is just entirely flat and there's no personality to it or the characters besides some incredibly tired archetypes. Little cat has a normal voice. Big alien has a normal voice (and his name is Earl, ain't that hilarious!). Aquatic alien girl... normal voice.

The voice acting is hit and miss across the board.  Some of them fit, others are more generic.  Angry alien, normal alien, child robot, grizzled veteran human.  They all sound relatively alike which is difficult when in a firefight everyone sounds similar when sounding off their abilities.  Take Overwatch for example, you damn well know who said what and where when the abilities are going off.

&gt; * Going into the game itself, the initial spawn and respawn system seem so... pointless. There's about 8-10 different drop points but they're clumped together across your side of the map. Respawning takes way too long with a 20+ second death timer followed by the same animation of you going through warp onto the field.

After playing for a few hours, I've noticed that the spawns do change dynamically over the course of a match depending on which objectives are captured and where the hotspots are in combat.... kinda.  If your team is getting shitcanned, your options are limited, think kinda like the Battlefield series.  There is some retooling that needs to be done, but I don't think I can offer a better solution off the top.

&gt; * Movement speed feels sluggish, especially considering how big that map is. Movement abilities don't carry much range unless you're ""generic shooter guy"" with a straight up sprint, which wasn't even that quick either.

When in combat with other hunters, the speed seems okay, but the traversal to get to locations can be extremely tiresome.  You'll end up walking a couple minutes and end up after the party is over.  With this huge map, out of combat speed needs a buff, or maybe something like Heroes of the Storm where you can summon a mount for movement out of combat only.

&gt; * Some animations just ""snap"" to one another, and have zero flow. Jumping and shooting was the big one I noticed.

It's a nitpick, but most of the animations seem to have some lag to them.  It's much more of an issue when it comes to melee champs, the animation in comparison to the hitboxes seems off and the feedback for on-hit effects feels non-existent.  Makes playing the big tanky boys a chore and unfun.

&gt; * Weapons have no impact whatsoever and you just have to look at everyone's health slowly deplete regardless of what you're using. It's also hard to ever catch up to anyone running away, you just kinda stay at the same distance through a chase unless they try to turn and fight.

Everyone has a movement option or escape option ... kinda.  The generic soldier has a sprint button, the tanky alien has a dash, the heavy weapons alien has a rocket booster, etc etc.  However, in the experience I've had thus far, there are ways to close the distance with smart pathing, teamwork, and ability usage.  The only feedback you're going to get that you're doing something right though is either health bars dropping and hopes and prayers.  If I throw a flashbang, there is no way I know I've blinded the target.  If I hit them with a net grenade, there's no way I know I've slowed them.  They almost act the same either way.

&gt; * Hero abilities are also incredibly weak and some seem so out of place considering the setting/size of the map. Flashbangs, in a huge open alien area. A mine that's probably the size of a foot. Rogue girl's kit is a dash, and then three weapons you just swap between to reload their ammo. No character to her kit at all, and none of them packed any punch.

The grizzeld vet's flashbang would be better serviced as a blinding smoke grenade.  The rogue girl's weapons feel like grizzled veteran's weapons.  It's weird, cause I can't tell how much damage I'm really doing with them, so why bother?  Feedback is pretty bad overall.

&gt; * The map as a whole is, again, very large, and very empty. The trash mobs spawn in small group at set areas, the ones that do attack you are always alone and incredibly weak anyways. Med kits are placed in really bad spots from a level design perspective (if there's human constructs present, keep the health kits there and let the healing plants exist on the natural aspects).

Yeah, the map just needs retooling or perhaps downsizing due to the amount of people versus the amount of objectives to make.  It feels like this whole game started out as a Battle Royale and some exec decided to pivot when they saw it wasn't going to work in the same market share. 

&gt; * Secondary objectives are easy to capture and just forget about entirely. They offer bonus XP or XP gain? Not even sure. There's not much incentive to it when you can kill trash mobs just as well.

The XP is shared across the whole team, so there's definitely incentive as getting more levels boosts your overall damage output and max health on top of getting perks to your hunters.  However, the ""big bad"" called a Hive can easily be soloed with almost any character in relatively short time for thousands of XP.  I can cheese levels out of them very quickly with little counter-play available.

&gt; * The core objective, a Hive Heart, only starts to spawn *when the countdown hits zero*. It hardly even fights, just shoots bursts of homing projectiles, Make that whole lead up more lively, let it have some presence and do something to counter just sitting on top of it for five whole minutes since there's nothing else to do on that whole map.

As said above, they're very not ""raid boss"" like as the trailers implied.

&gt; * Animations for capturing objectives are just so lifeless. If there isn't much to interact with at least give them all unique animations, and make them actually touch what they're messing with.

Yeah, they just sorta stand around.  If they want to do it for the sake of simplicity, they need to have something more visible to show that an objective is being taken.  In the harvester rush mode, it doesn't even register that a objective is being captured on your hud really.

&gt; * A single fight determines the objective immediately. In fact, a single kill probably does; respawns are too unforgiving, heroes move far too slow and damage from guns and abilities just feels so insignificant.

Thats kind of how it's designed though, very League of Legends in that a big team fight will determine the next few minutes rather than it being a prolonged siege.

Another point to make is the UI sucks in-game.  They give you this detective mode button that is supposed to highlight objectives around you and give you a look at what to do next, but it barely works.  The HUD doesn't have waypoints, the map barely distinguishes you from the other units, I'll get lost constantly trying to find my tiny picture in a sea of other units.  Other units will have priority over yours, so you can't see yourself in the first place cause someone is too near you.  

The common underlying problem seems to be just lacking in the little things, the polish, the quality of life issues other games already mastered.  It's definitely an annoying experience that just isn't quite ready for primetime yet.",1590082898,1,1590079298.0
37,basketball_curry,"I dont mean any disrespect but I sincerely doubt we're anywhere close to that. Look at the buzz for diablo 4 and the mere rumor of a diablo 2 remaster. They may catch a lot of flak for a lot of things (perhaps deservedly so), but what major release have they had that truly flopped? I cant think of any other than wc3 reforged. Heroes of the storm might qualify, but that was a free to play game made on starcrafts engine by a relatively small team, and even it was fairly popular for a time. I'm not a wow guy so idk the status of their expansions, but I know they're still bringing in millions of subscribers which is absolutely insane for this day and age, particularly for a game as old as wow. Overwatch and hearthstone were and continue to be huge successes. Diablo 3 started off rocky but has rebounded considerably and continues to make them tons of money with little oversight required. The starcraft 2 expansions weren't nearly as impressive as the initial wings of liberty but they also didnt require as much development effort and still did moderately okay. Not sure how well starcraft remastered sold but again, it was a small team with a minor budget and I think it went well. 

So wc3 reforged drew a lot of ire and I'm sure didnt hit expected sales numbers, that's one game in the last decade. Most of, if not all, their other ones have done well. It's very clear that their products now are a bit dulled down for the masses and dont convey the same sense of passion and commitment like games of their pre Activision days, but by and large they're still fine products within popular franchises that many people enjoy.

Honestly Blizzard is the one company that has really and truly shit the bed in my eyes. I get that a lot of people spew bullcrap about companies and then buy their games anyway, but as somebody who used to be a huge Blizzard fan from like 1995-2008, I just don't care about any of their stuff anymore.

Given, I already thought Blizzard had gone downhill since the Activision merger. But I still bought all their games because why not. But Diablo III was a letdown, they let StarCraft II die off, Heroes of the Storm happened, Hearthstone just felt like them sucking money out of customers.

Overwatch felt like the tipping point to me - where clearly a lot of people like it, but it feels *really* uninspired to me personally and I guess I just realized Blizzard is a different company now with different fans. 

I *would* have bought Diablo IV because I loved the original games. But after the recent shit with Chinese censorship, with Diablo Immortal... I didn't buy Reforged, I stopped paying attention to WoW at all, and I decided I won't be buying any of their stuff in the future, Diablo IV included.

I don't feel this way about any of those other companies. I quite like Ubisoft personally, Konami decided to move in a different direction, and Take-Two can do whatever they want with GTA Online, I don't think it's hurting anybody (and I like the single player game)... and their stuff with 2K is just fine.

Bethesda I feel less warm about, but that's more just because of terrible direction in their game design that has been going downhill for like a decade now. If they came out with a new game that was really good, I'd buy it. I can't say the same for Blizzard at this point.",1590540184,1,1590536584.0

D3:RoS was fantastic. Heroes of the Storm.... I don't know where to put this. 50/50 good/bad. I don't like it but a significant amount of ppl got pissed that they dropped support.

  Overwatch in 2016 was fantastic. Legion in 2016 was my favorite expansion ever. 

Starcraft Remastered in 2017 was great.

 BFA in 2018 was shitty. I think most ppl would say WoW has been 50/50 with good/bad expansions since 2010. Shadowlands being on the good side of the pattern.

WC3 reforged in 2020 was probably their worst game ever.

&gt;Diablo 2 HD, feels like going backwards even further. Prolific mobile game marketing. What else is there?

I don't see how the Pacific mobile game marketing matters. Did Animal Crossing mobile affect Animal Crossing: New Horizons?

Overwatch 2, Shadowlands, and Diablo 4? 

Even if you are skeptical of Overwatch 2, its free content for base Overwatch 1. Shadowlands is a WoW expansion so its a hit or miss. And Diablo4 has potential, bringing back the D2 iconography and artstyle with the gameplay of D3.

I just have a hard time understanding how a LoL (or Heroes ;)) player can look at metrics like hero pick/ban rates in tournaments, and not be at least a LITTLE envious of Dota's design. Or how heroes can fit multiple roles/lanes/positions, and drafting becomes a much richer mind game (in Dota). It definitely bothered me.

With multiplayer games, we want progression systems - either in the form of better loot like World of Warcraft or leaderboards like Rocket League. This game is kind of missing both. It has loot, but it's all purely cosmetic and it has leaderboards, but those are only for a portion of the game.

With that said, I've been playing this game fairly consistently for nearly 3 months now and I'm loving it. What's not to love about a pirate-themed sandbox? And thanks to the regular updates that this game receives, there's so much variety in what you can do. Tall Tales, voyages strictly for gold, emissaries for MORE gold, or become a Reaper's Bones emissary and start hunting down other players. Maybe you want to take on a Skeleton Fort or Armada?

Or maybe you just want to sit around and fish. That's what my crew and I have been doing this past week. Fishing and shooting the shit, just like real life but with hundreds of miles of social distancing.

**echochrome** [trailer](https://youtu.be/GybxIwfU4rI) &amp; **echochrome ii** [trailer](https://youtu.be/jUUh_1EzD0Y)

Pretty trippy downloadable-only titles where you control the perspective of the MC Escher-esque levels to get your marionette character from one end to the other. Set to a very pleasing orchestral soundtrack as well. The sequel requires a Move controller setup. 

**The Last Guy** [trailer](https://youtu.be/mYcwk0HouhU)

Overhead-style game where you control one last guy to herd all remaining survivors to safe zones in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic world.

**Yakuza: Dead Souls** [trailer](https://youtu.be/01xI7w2EdLc)

Entirely separate spinoff where it’s a survival horror zombie fuelled game set in the Yakuza universe. Recommended for completionist sake of the series

**Katamari Forever** [trailer](https://youtu.be/6FC28EwjpvU)

It’s Katamari on PS3. One of the greatest game series and comes with some excellent modes like Eternal Katamari. 

**White Knight Chronicles I &amp; II** [trailer](https://youtu.be/FIoIGmJqfPQ)

Both are cursed with mediocrity tbh, and nowadays aren’t really worth checking out solely due to its single player aspect being very subpar when compared to the multiplayer portion. In its prime, it was compared to a beefy single-player-feeling JRPG MMO (if that makes sense). But since it’s well past its prime, it’s really only worth looking into for a curiosity of a bygone time. Plus, if you can find a copy of WKC2 it comes with the first on-disc.

**House of the Dead III &amp; 4**

Really great remasters of the original arcade games and are a ton of fun. Fully playable with Move as well as 2-player support. 

**Time Crisis: Razing Storm**

Same as above, very faithful arcade version of the game with Move and multiplayer support. Even includes awesome versions of Deadstorm Pirates and Time Crisis 4!

**Class of Heroes 2G, Cross Edge, Time and Eternity, Trinity Universe, The Guided Fate Paradox, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum, Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord**

Tbh I haven’t played any of these, but they’re very overlooked JRPG’s that are exclusive to the system. 

**Child of Eden** [trailer](https://youtu.be/ZxH-HbvF01M)

This one also appeared on 360 and even received BC treatment for XBO. Having said that, it’s a very beautiful rail shooter-type game and I think is a prequel to Rez. It’s fully playable with Move controllers and that’s my preferred way of playing. I just wish I was able to try it in 3D as it is a very beautiful game. 

**Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom** [trailer](https://youtu.be/dIE3eV8HFPk)

Again, playable on 360 as well. From the devs of Folklore comes this very flawed but charming game where your character befriends and is able to control a bumbling creature called Majin and try to escape a castle. I think that’s what it is anyways, it’s been a while. I remember really enjoying my time with this one tho 

**El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron** [trailer](https://youtu.be/li0yID0-l9w)

Rounding out the overlooked only-appears-on-PS3-and-360 games comes this actual hidden gem. It’s got a great art style and really cool combat system and even has a lengthy campaign. Highly recommend if you can find a copy

Also there’s the Resistance trilogy, all Ratchet and Clanks, all Sly Coopers, MotorStorm trilogy, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Drakengard 3, Nier, Gran Turismo 5 &amp; 6, Killzone trilogy, Dead Nation, but most of these are widely popular.",1589788360,1,1589784760.0

Smite has the best and most diverse game modes, Heroes of the Storm has the iconic pop characters and maps, lol has the vast majority of different champions but its super toxic and try-hard (atleast from a casual perspective), Dota 2 i cant say much.

So if you want to go with any Moba i suggest Smite ore Heroes of the Storm, both of them are casual friendly, have a lot of iconic characters and you can have success as a casual and wont get flamed much either, contrary to Lol or Dota 2 (as far as i have heard).",1590440111,1,1590436511.0

Having that said, I don't think it's too controversial to say that Overwatch experienced a rapidly fading competitive scene due to a lackluster meta, the lack of a meaningful progression system, and slow content updates.

Overall, Overwatch just isn't that much different from the game that launched 4 years ago. That, to me, is a lack of investment. 

Blizzard launched a pretty good game and didn't even attempt to evolve it into something great, and so it's declined.

At least Heroes of the Storm *tried* to evolve and morph and be great. I just don't see that effort on Overwatch.

And it should be *easier* for Blizzard, too. That's what really baffles me. It's not like other hero games where you buy the heroes. If there's a problem hero, just remove the hero from the game. They could have killed GOATS by just removing Reinhardt or D'va.

67,Mathematik,"I just want to add some more context and some ideas to fix it for a pretty exhaustive list.

&gt; * The store front is a complete eyesore, they just show you every individual item all at once, rather than break it down into cosmetic categories or by hero.

There are no filters in the store front and it's just one giant page of items to scroll through with some featured / limited time items at the top.  They need to have a better sorting method with something quick and easy to see what you want and what you would get at a glance.  I have poor vision anyways, and it's not only an eyesore, but cumbersome to read.

&gt; * There's no ""lore/bio' on characters that I saw, yet one of them (the rogue looking girl) tells you her backstory over the course of 5 or 6 voice clips you only hear if you click on her over and over on the hero select screen.

There is definitely lore and information for the characters in the Collections tab off of the main menu.  As you play a character you'll unlock audio logs about the hunters as you level them up and play with them more.  The team could stand to create some in-universe trailers showing the hunters interacting with one another or fleshing out their backstories at bit in a show, don't tell fashion.

&gt; * On that note, voice work is just entirely flat and there's no personality to it or the characters besides some incredibly tired archetypes. Little cat has a normal voice. Big alien has a normal voice (and his name is Earl, ain't that hilarious!). Aquatic alien girl... normal voice.

The voice acting is hit and miss across the board.  Some of them fit, others are more generic.  Angry alien, normal alien, child robot, grizzled veteran human.  They all sound relatively alike which is difficult when in a firefight everyone sounds similar when sounding off their abilities.  Take Overwatch for example, you damn well know who said what and where when the abilities are going off.

&gt; * Going into the game itself, the initial spawn and respawn system seem so... pointless. There's about 8-10 different drop points but they're clumped together across your side of the map. Respawning takes way too long with a 20+ second death timer followed by the same animation of you going through warp onto the field.

After playing for a few hours, I've noticed that the spawns do change dynamically over the course of a match depending on which objectives are captured and where the hotspots are in combat.... kinda.  If your team is getting shitcanned, your options are limited, think kinda like the Battlefield series.  There is some retooling that needs to be done, but I don't think I can offer a better solution off the top.

&gt; * Movement speed feels sluggish, especially considering how big that map is. Movement abilities don't carry much range unless you're ""generic shooter guy"" with a straight up sprint, which wasn't even that quick either.

When in combat with other hunters, the speed seems okay, but the traversal to get to locations can be extremely tiresome.  You'll end up walking a couple minutes and end up after the party is over.  With this huge map, out of combat speed needs a buff, or maybe something like Heroes of the Storm where you can summon a mount for movement out of combat only.

&gt; * Some animations just ""snap"" to one another, and have zero flow. Jumping and shooting was the big one I noticed.

It's a nitpick, but most of the animations seem to have some lag to them.  It's much more of an issue when it comes to melee champs, the animation in comparison to the hitboxes seems off and the feedback for on-hit effects feels non-existent.  Makes playing the big tanky boys a chore and unfun.

&gt; * Weapons have no impact whatsoever and you just have to look at everyone's health slowly deplete regardless of what you're using. It's also hard to ever catch up to anyone running away, you just kinda stay at the same distance through a chase unless they try to turn and fight.

Everyone has a movement option or escape option ... kinda.  The generic soldier has a sprint button, the tanky alien has a dash, the heavy weapons alien has a rocket booster, etc etc.  However, in the experience I've had thus far, there are ways to close the distance with smart pathing, teamwork, and ability usage.  The only feedback you're going to get that you're doing something right though is either health bars dropping and hopes and prayers.  If I throw a flashbang, there is no way I know I've blinded the target.  If I hit them with a net grenade, there's no way I know I've slowed them.  They almost act the same either way.

&gt; * Hero abilities are also incredibly weak and some seem so out of place considering the setting/size of the map. Flashbangs, in a huge open alien area. A mine that's probably the size of a foot. Rogue girl's kit is a dash, and then three weapons you just swap between to reload their ammo. No character to her kit at all, and none of them packed any punch.

The grizzeld vet's flashbang would be better serviced as a blinding smoke grenade.  The rogue girl's weapons feel like grizzled veteran's weapons.  It's weird, cause I can't tell how much damage I'm really doing with them, so why bother?  Feedback is pretty bad overall.

&gt; * The map as a whole is, again, very large, and very empty. The trash mobs spawn in small group at set areas, the ones that do attack you are always alone and incredibly weak anyways. Med kits are placed in really bad spots from a level design perspective (if there's human constructs present, keep the health kits there and let the healing plants exist on the natural aspects).

Yeah, the map just needs retooling or perhaps downsizing due to the amount of people versus the amount of objectives to make.  It feels like this whole game started out as a Battle Royale and some exec decided to pivot when they saw it wasn't going to work in the same market share. 

&gt; * Secondary objectives are easy to capture and just forget about entirely. They offer bonus XP or XP gain? Not even sure. There's not much incentive to it when you can kill trash mobs just as well.

The XP is shared across the whole team, so there's definitely incentive as getting more levels boosts your overall damage output and max health on top of getting perks to your hunters.  However, the ""big bad"" called a Hive can easily be soloed with almost any character in relatively short time for thousands of XP.  I can cheese levels out of them very quickly with little counter-play available.

&gt; * The core objective, a Hive Heart, only starts to spawn *when the countdown hits zero*. It hardly even fights, just shoots bursts of homing projectiles, Make that whole lead up more lively, let it have some presence and do something to counter just sitting on top of it for five whole minutes since there's nothing else to do on that whole map.

As said above, they're very not ""raid boss"" like as the trailers implied.

&gt; * Animations for capturing objectives are just so lifeless. If there isn't much to interact with at least give them all unique animations, and make them actually touch what they're messing with.

Yeah, they just sorta stand around.  If they want to do it for the sake of simplicity, they need to have something more visible to show that an objective is being taken.  In the harvester rush mode, it doesn't even register that a objective is being captured on your hud really.

&gt; * A single fight determines the objective immediately. In fact, a single kill probably does; respawns are too unforgiving, heroes move far too slow and damage from guns and abilities just feels so insignificant.

Thats kind of how it's designed though, very League of Legends in that a big team fight will determine the next few minutes rather than it being a prolonged siege.

Another point to make is the UI sucks in-game.  They give you this detective mode button that is supposed to highlight objectives around you and give you a look at what to do next, but it barely works.  The HUD doesn't have waypoints, the map barely distinguishes you from the other units, I'll get lost constantly trying to find my tiny picture in a sea of other units.  Other units will have priority over yours, so you can't see yourself in the first place cause someone is too near you.  

The common underlying problem seems to be just lacking in the little things, the polish, the quality of life issues other games already mastered.  It's definitely an annoying experience that just isn't quite ready for primetime yet.",1590082898,1,1590079298.0
68,basketball_curry,"I dont mean any disrespect but I sincerely doubt we're anywhere close to that. Look at the buzz for diablo 4 and the mere rumor of a diablo 2 remaster. They may catch a lot of flak for a lot of things (perhaps deservedly so), but what major release have they had that truly flopped? I cant think of any other than wc3 reforged. Heroes of the storm might qualify, but that was a free to play game made on starcrafts engine by a relatively small team, and even it was fairly popular for a time. I'm not a wow guy so idk the status of their expansions, but I know they're still bringing in millions of subscribers which is absolutely insane for this day and age, particularly for a game as old as wow. Overwatch and hearthstone were and continue to be huge successes. Diablo 3 started off rocky but has rebounded considerably and continues to make them tons of money with little oversight required. The starcraft 2 expansions weren't nearly as impressive as the initial wings of liberty but they also didnt require as much development effort and still did moderately okay. Not sure how well starcraft remastered sold but again, it was a small team with a minor budget and I think it went well. 

So wc3 reforged drew a lot of ire and I'm sure didnt hit expected sales numbers, that's one game in the last decade. Most of, if not all, their other ones have done well. It's very clear that their products now are a bit dulled down for the masses and dont convey the same sense of passion and commitment like games of their pre Activision days, but by and large they're still fine products within popular franchises that many people enjoy.

Honestly Blizzard is the one company that has really and truly shit the bed in my eyes. I get that a lot of people spew bullcrap about companies and then buy their games anyway, but as somebody who used to be a huge Blizzard fan from like 1995-2008, I just don't care about any of their stuff anymore.

Given, I already thought Blizzard had gone downhill since the Activision merger. But I still bought all their games because why not. But Diablo III was a letdown, they let StarCraft II die off, Heroes of the Storm happened, Hearthstone just felt like them sucking money out of customers.

Overwatch felt like the tipping point to me - where clearly a lot of people like it, but it feels *really* uninspired to me personally and I guess I just realized Blizzard is a different company now with different fans. 

I *would* have bought Diablo IV because I loved the original games. But after the recent shit with Chinese censorship, with Diablo Immortal... I didn't buy Reforged, I stopped paying attention to WoW at all, and I decided I won't be buying any of their stuff in the future, Diablo IV included.

I don't feel this way about any of those other companies. I quite like Ubisoft personally, Konami decided to move in a different direction, and Take-Two can do whatever they want with GTA Online, I don't think it's hurting anybody (and I like the single player game)... and their stuff with 2K is just fine.

Bethesda I feel less warm about, but that's more just because of terrible direction in their game design that has been going downhill for like a decade now. If they came out with a new game that was really good, I'd buy it. I can't say the same for Blizzard at this point.",1590540184,1,1590536584.0

D3:RoS was fantastic. Heroes of the Storm.... I don't know where to put this. 50/50 good/bad. I don't like it but a significant amount of ppl got pissed that they dropped support.

  Overwatch in 2016 was fantastic. Legion in 2016 was my favorite expansion ever. 

Starcraft Remastered in 2017 was great.

 BFA in 2018 was shitty. I think most ppl would say WoW has been 50/50 with good/bad expansions since 2010. Shadowlands being on the good side of the pattern.

WC3 reforged in 2020 was probably their worst game ever.

&gt;Diablo 2 HD, feels like going backwards even further. Prolific mobile game marketing. What else is there?

I don't see how the Pacific mobile game marketing matters. Did Animal Crossing mobile affect Animal Crossing: New Horizons?

Overwatch 2, Shadowlands, and Diablo 4? 

Even if you are skeptical of Overwatch 2, its free content for base Overwatch 1. Shadowlands is a WoW expansion so its a hit or miss. And Diablo4 has potential, bringing back the D2 iconography and artstyle with the gameplay of D3.

86,Danulas,"This subreddit has a rough perception about this game. With multiplayer games, we want progression systems - either in the form of better loot like World of Warcraft or leaderboards like Rocket League. This game is kind of missing both. It has loot, but it's all purely cosmetic and it has leaderboards, but those are only for a portion of the game.

With that said, I've been playing this game fairly consistently for nearly 3 months now and I'm loving it. What's not to love about a pirate-themed sandbox? And thanks to the regular updates that this game receives, there's so much variety in what you can do. Tall Tales, voyages strictly for gold, emissaries for MORE gold, or become a Reaper's Bones emissary and start hunting down other players. Maybe you want to take on a Skeleton Fort or Armada?

Or maybe you just want to sit around and fish. That's what my crew and I have been doing this past week. Fishing and shooting the shit, just like real life but with hundreds of miles of social distancing. Even that can get interesting when you need to fish in the middle of a storm or in a battle with a skeleton ship.

**echochrome** [trailer](https://youtu.be/GybxIwfU4rI) &amp; **echochrome ii** [trailer](https://youtu.be/jUUh_1EzD0Y)

Pretty trippy downloadable-only titles where you control the perspective of the MC Escher-esque levels to get your marionette character from one end to the other. Set to a very pleasing orchestral soundtrack as well. The sequel requires a Move controller setup. 

**The Last Guy** [trailer](https://youtu.be/mYcwk0HouhU)

Overhead-style game where you control one last guy to herd all remaining survivors to safe zones in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic world.

**Yakuza: Dead Souls** [trailer](https://youtu.be/01xI7w2EdLc)

Entirely separate spinoff where it’s a survival horror zombie fuelled game set in the Yakuza universe. Recommended for completionist sake of the series

**Katamari Forever** [trailer](https://youtu.be/6FC28EwjpvU)

It’s Katamari on PS3. One of the greatest game series and comes with some excellent modes like Eternal Katamari. 

**White Knight Chronicles I &amp; II** [trailer](https://youtu.be/FIoIGmJqfPQ)

Both are cursed with mediocrity tbh, and nowadays aren’t really worth checking out solely due to its single player aspect being very subpar when compared to the multiplayer portion. In its prime, it was compared to a beefy single-player-feeling JRPG MMO (if that makes sense). But since it’s well past its prime, it’s really only worth looking into for a curiosity of a bygone time. Plus, if you can find a copy of WKC2 it comes with the first on-disc.

**House of the Dead III &amp; 4**

Really great remasters of the original arcade games and are a ton of fun. Fully playable with Move as well as 2-player support. 

**Time Crisis: Razing Storm**

Same as above, very faithful arcade version of the game with Move and multiplayer support. Even includes awesome versions of Deadstorm Pirates and Time Crisis 4!

**Class of Heroes 2G, Cross Edge, Time and Eternity, Trinity Universe, The Guided Fate Paradox, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum, Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord**

Tbh I haven’t played any of these, but they’re very overlooked JRPG’s that are exclusive to the system. 

**Child of Eden** [trailer](https://youtu.be/ZxH-HbvF01M)

This one also appeared on 360 and even received BC treatment for XBO. Having said that, it’s a very beautiful rail shooter-type game and I think is a prequel to Rez. It’s fully playable with Move controllers and that’s my preferred way of playing. I just wish I was able to try it in 3D as it is a very beautiful game. 

**Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom** [trailer](https://youtu.be/dIE3eV8HFPk)

Again, playable on 360 as well. From the devs of Folklore comes this very flawed but charming game where your character befriends and is able to control a bumbling creature called Majin and try to escape a castle. I think that’s what it is anyways, it’s been a while. I remember really enjoying my time with this one tho 

**El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron** [trailer](https://youtu.be/li0yID0-l9w)

Rounding out the overlooked only-appears-on-PS3-and-360 games comes this actual hidden gem. It’s got a great art style and really cool combat system and even has a lengthy campaign. Highly recommend if you can find a copy

Also there’s the Resistance trilogy, all Ratchet and Clanks, all Sly Coopers, MotorStorm trilogy, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Drakengard 3, Nier, Gran Turismo 5 &amp; 6, Killzone trilogy, Dead Nation, but most of these are widely popular.",1589788360,1,1589784760.0

Smite has the best and most diverse game modes, Heroes of the Storm has the iconic pop characters and maps, lol has the vast majority of different champions but its super toxic and try-hard (atleast from a casual perspective), Dota 2 i cant say much.

So if you want to go with any Moba i suggest Smite ore Heroes of the Storm, both of them are casual friendly, have a lot of iconic characters and you can have success as a casual and wont get flamed much either, contrary to Lol or Dota 2 (as far as i have heard).",1590440111,1,1590436511.0

93,Mathematik,"I just want to add some more context and some ideas to fix it for a pretty exhaustive list.

&gt; * The store front is a complete eyesore, they just show you every individual item all at once, rather than break it down into cosmetic categories or by hero.

There are no filters in the store front and it's just one giant page of items to scroll through with some featured / limited time items at the top.  They need to have a better sorting method with something quick and easy to see what you want and what you would get at a glance.  I have poor vision anyways, and it's not only an eyesore, but cumbersome to read.

&gt; * There's no ""lore/bio' on characters that I saw, yet one of them (the rogue looking girl) tells you her backstory over the course of 5 or 6 voice clips you only hear if you click on her over and over on the hero select screen.

There is definitely lore and information for the characters in the Collections tab off of the main menu.  As you play a character you'll unlock audio logs about the hunters as you level them up and play with them more.  The team could stand to create some in-universe trailers showing the hunters interacting with one another or fleshing out their backstories at bit in a show, don't tell fashion.

&gt; * On that note, voice work is just entirely flat and there's no personality to it or the characters besides some incredibly tired archetypes. Little cat has a normal voice. Big alien has a normal voice (and his name is Earl, ain't that hilarious!). Aquatic alien girl... normal voice.

The voice acting is hit and miss across the board.  Some of them fit, others are more generic.  Angry alien, normal alien, child robot, grizzled veteran human.  They all sound relatively alike which is difficult when in a firefight everyone sounds similar when sounding off their abilities.  Take Overwatch for example, you damn well know who said what and where when the abilities are going off.

&gt; * Going into the game itself, the initial spawn and respawn system seem so... pointless. There's about 8-10 different drop points but they're clumped together across your side of the map. Respawning takes way too long with a 20+ second death timer followed by the same animation of you going through warp onto the field.

After playing for a few hours, I've noticed that the spawns do change dynamically over the course of a match depending on which objectives are captured and where the hotspots are in combat.... kinda.  If your team is getting shitcanned, your options are limited, think kinda like the Battlefield series.  There is some retooling that needs to be done, but I don't think I can offer a better solution off the top.

&gt; * Movement speed feels sluggish, especially considering how big that map is. Movement abilities don't carry much range unless you're ""generic shooter guy"" with a straight up sprint, which wasn't even that quick either.

When in combat with other hunters, the speed seems okay, but the traversal to get to locations can be extremely tiresome.  You'll end up walking a couple minutes and end up after the party is over.  With this huge map, out of combat speed needs a buff, or maybe something like Heroes of the Storm where you can summon a mount for movement out of combat only.

&gt; * Some animations just ""snap"" to one another, and have zero flow. Jumping and shooting was the big one I noticed.

It's a nitpick, but most of the animations seem to have some lag to them.  It's much more of an issue when it comes to melee champs, the animation in comparison to the hitboxes seems off and the feedback for on-hit effects feels non-existent.  Makes playing the big tanky boys a chore and unfun.

&gt; * Weapons have no impact whatsoever and you just have to look at everyone's health slowly deplete regardless of what you're using. It's also hard to ever catch up to anyone running away, you just kinda stay at the same distance through a chase unless they try to turn and fight.

Everyone has a movement option or escape option ... kinda.  The generic soldier has a sprint button, the tanky alien has a dash, the heavy weapons alien has a rocket booster, etc etc.  However, in the experience I've had thus far, there are ways to close the distance with smart pathing, teamwork, and ability usage.  The only feedback you're going to get that you're doing something right though is either health bars dropping and hopes and prayers.  If I throw a flashbang, there is no way I know I've blinded the target.  If I hit them with a net grenade, there's no way I know I've slowed them.  They almost act the same either way.

&gt; * Hero abilities are also incredibly weak and some seem so out of place considering the setting/size of the map. Flashbangs, in a huge open alien area. A mine that's probably the size of a foot. Rogue girl's kit is a dash, and then three weapons you just swap between to reload their ammo. No character to her kit at all, and none of them packed any punch.

The grizzeld vet's flashbang would be better serviced as a blinding smoke grenade.  The rogue girl's weapons feel like grizzled veteran's weapons.  It's weird, cause I can't tell how much damage I'm really doing with them, so why bother?  Feedback is pretty bad overall.

&gt; * The map as a whole is, again, very large, and very empty. The trash mobs spawn in small group at set areas, the ones that do attack you are always alone and incredibly weak anyways. Med kits are placed in really bad spots from a level design perspective (if there's human constructs present, keep the health kits there and let the healing plants exist on the natural aspects).

Yeah, the map just needs retooling or perhaps downsizing due to the amount of people versus the amount of objectives to make.  It feels like this whole game started out as a Battle Royale and some exec decided to pivot when they saw it wasn't going to work in the same market share. 

&gt; * Secondary objectives are easy to capture and just forget about entirely. They offer bonus XP or XP gain? Not even sure. There's not much incentive to it when you can kill trash mobs just as well.

The XP is shared across the whole team, so there's definitely incentive as getting more levels boosts your overall damage output and max health on top of getting perks to your hunters.  However, the ""big bad"" called a Hive can easily be soloed with almost any character in relatively short time for thousands of XP.  I can cheese levels out of them very quickly with little counter-play available.

&gt; * The core objective, a Hive Heart, only starts to spawn *when the countdown hits zero*. It hardly even fights, just shoots bursts of homing projectiles, Make that whole lead up more lively, let it have some presence and do something to counter just sitting on top of it for five whole minutes since there's nothing else to do on that whole map.

As said above, they're very not ""raid boss"" like as the trailers implied.

&gt; * Animations for capturing objectives are just so lifeless. If there isn't much to interact with at least give them all unique animations, and make them actually touch what they're messing with.

Yeah, they just sorta stand around.  If they want to do it for the sake of simplicity, they need to have something more visible to show that an objective is being taken.  In the harvester rush mode, it doesn't even register that a objective is being captured on your hud really.

&gt; * A single fight determines the objective immediately. In fact, a single kill probably does; respawns are too unforgiving, heroes move far too slow and damage from guns and abilities just feels so insignificant.

Thats kind of how it's designed though, very League of Legends in that a big team fight will determine the next few minutes rather than it being a prolonged siege.

Another point to make is the UI sucks in-game.  They give you this detective mode button that is supposed to highlight objectives around you and give you a look at what to do next, but it barely works.  The HUD doesn't have waypoints, the map barely distinguishes you from the other units, I'll get lost constantly trying to find my tiny picture in a sea of other units.  Other units will have priority over yours, so you can't see yourself in the first place cause someone is too near you.  

The common underlying problem seems to be just lacking in the little things, the polish, the quality of life issues other games already mastered.  It's definitely an annoying experience that just isn't quite ready for primetime yet.",1590082898,1,1590079298.0
94,basketball_curry,"I dont mean any disrespect but I sincerely doubt we're anywhere close to that. Look at the buzz for diablo 4 and the mere rumor of a diablo 2 remaster. They may catch a lot of flak for a lot of things (perhaps deservedly so), but what major release have they had that truly flopped? I cant think of any other than wc3 reforged. Heroes of the storm might qualify, but that was a free to play game made on starcrafts engine by a relatively small team, and even it was fairly popular for a time. I'm not a wow guy so idk the status of their expansions, but I know they're still bringing in millions of subscribers which is absolutely insane for this day and age, particularly for a game as old as wow. Overwatch and hearthstone were and continue to be huge successes. Diablo 3 started off rocky but has rebounded considerably and continues to make them tons of money with little oversight required. The starcraft 2 expansions weren't nearly as impressive as the initial wings of liberty but they also didnt require as much development effort and still did moderately okay. Not sure how well starcraft remastered sold but again, it was a small team with a minor budget and I think it went well. 

So wc3 reforged drew a lot of ire and I'm sure didnt hit expected sales numbers, that's one game in the last decade. Most of, if not all, their other ones have done well. It's very clear that their products now are a bit dulled down for the masses and dont convey the same sense of passion and commitment like games of their pre Activision days, but by and large they're still fine products within popular franchises that many people enjoy.

109,Danulas,"This subreddit has a rough perception about this game. With multiplayer games, we want progression systems - either in the form of better loot like World of Warcraft or leaderboards like Rocket League. This game is kind of missing both. It has loot, but it's all purely cosmetic and it has leaderboards, but those are only for a portion of the game.

With that said, I've been playing this game fairly consistently for nearly 3 months now and I'm loving it. What's not to love about a pirate-themed sandbox? And thanks to the regular updates that this game receives, there's so much variety in what you can do. Tall Tales, voyages strictly for gold, emissaries for MORE gold, or become a Reaper's Bones emissary and start hunting down other players. Maybe you want to take on a Skeleton Fort or Armada?

Or maybe you just want to sit around and fish. That's what my crew and I have been doing this past week. Fishing and shooting the shit, just like real life but with hundreds of miles of social distancing. Even that can get interesting when you need to fish in the middle of a storm or in a battle with a skeleton ship.

**echochrome** [trailer](https://youtu.be/GybxIwfU4rI) &amp; **echochrome ii** [trailer](https://youtu.be/jUUh_1EzD0Y)

Pretty trippy downloadable-only titles where you control the perspective of the MC Escher-esque levels to get your marionette character from one end to the other. Set to a very pleasing orchestral soundtrack as well. The sequel requires a Move controller setup. 

**The Last Guy** [trailer](https://youtu.be/mYcwk0HouhU)

Overhead-style game where you control one last guy to herd all remaining survivors to safe zones in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic world.

**Yakuza: Dead Souls** [trailer](https://youtu.be/01xI7w2EdLc)

Entirely separate spinoff where it’s a survival horror zombie fuelled game set in the Yakuza universe. Recommended for completionist sake of the series

**Katamari Forever** [trailer](https://youtu.be/6FC28EwjpvU)

It’s Katamari on PS3. One of the greatest game series and comes with some excellent modes like Eternal Katamari. 

**White Knight Chronicles I &amp; II** [trailer](https://youtu.be/FIoIGmJqfPQ)

Both are cursed with mediocrity tbh, and nowadays aren’t really worth checking out solely due to its single player aspect being very subpar when compared to the multiplayer portion. In its prime, it was compared to a beefy single-player-feeling JRPG MMO (if that makes sense). But since it’s well past its prime, it’s really only worth looking into for a curiosity of a bygone time. Plus, if you can find a copy of WKC2 it comes with the first on-disc.

**House of the Dead III &amp; 4**

Really great remasters of the original arcade games and are a ton of fun. Fully playable with Move as well as 2-player support. 

**Time Crisis: Razing Storm**

Same as above, very faithful arcade version of the game with Move and multiplayer support. Even includes awesome versions of Deadstorm Pirates and Time Crisis 4!

**Class of Heroes 2G, Cross Edge, Time and Eternity, Trinity Universe, The Guided Fate Paradox, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum, Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord**

Tbh I haven’t played any of these, but they’re very overlooked JRPG’s that are exclusive to the system. 

**Child of Eden** [trailer](https://youtu.be/ZxH-HbvF01M)

This one also appeared on 360 and even received BC treatment for XBO. Having said that, it’s a very beautiful rail shooter-type game and I think is a prequel to Rez. It’s fully playable with Move controllers and that’s my preferred way of playing. I just wish I was able to try it in 3D as it is a very beautiful game. 

**Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom** [trailer](https://youtu.be/dIE3eV8HFPk)

Again, playable on 360 as well. From the devs of Folklore comes this very flawed but charming game where your character befriends and is able to control a bumbling creature called Majin and try to escape a castle. I think that’s what it is anyways, it’s been a while. I remember really enjoying my time with this one tho 

**El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron** [trailer](https://youtu.be/li0yID0-l9w)

Rounding out the overlooked only-appears-on-PS3-and-360 games comes this actual hidden gem. It’s got a great art style and really cool combat system and even has a lengthy campaign. Highly recommend if you can find a copy

Also there’s the Resistance trilogy, all Ratchet and Clanks, all Sly Coopers, MotorStorm trilogy, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Drakengard 3, Nier, Gran Turismo 5 &amp; 6, Killzone trilogy, Dead Nation, but most of these are widely popular.",1589788360,1,1589784760.0

They may catch a lot of flak for a lot of things (perhaps deservedly so), but what major release have they had that truly flopped? I cant think of any other than wc3 reforged. Heroes of the storm might qualify, but that was a free to play game made on starcrafts engine by a relatively small team, and even it was fairly popular for a time. I'm not a wow guy so idk the status of their expansions, but I know they're still bringing in millions of subscribers which is absolutely insane for this day and age, particularly for a game as old as wow. Overwatch and hearthstone were and continue to be huge successes. Diablo 3 started off rocky but has rebounded considerably and continues to make them tons of money with little oversight required. The starcraft 2 expansions weren't nearly as impressive as the initial wings of liberty but they also didnt require as much development effort and still did moderately okay. Not sure how well starcraft remastered sold but again, it was a small team with a minor budget and I think it went well. 

So wc3 reforged drew a lot of ire and I'm sure didnt hit expected sales numbers, that's one game in the last decade. Most of, if not all, their other ones have done well. It's very clear that their products now are a bit dulled down for the masses and dont convey the same sense of passion and commitment like games of their pre Activision days, but by and large they're still fine products within popular franchises that many people enjoy.

And unfortunately developers end up bending around this. In War Thunder the game tries to match you with players of equal vehicle rating for about thirty seconds, before it just gives up and tosses you in with something way higher or lower than you. And it's because if a queue takes longer than a minute, the game is ""dead"".

2,Clbull,"&gt; This guy should be fired without investigation, I'm sure he would view that as unfair and unjust, but perhaps it would help him to see the hypocrisy a bit.

It would be a fitting punishment for the exec of a company as dishonest as Riot.

[If you look at the post on Twitter they made in solidarity of BLM](https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1269001502145884163), and the sheer amount of people calling out Riot for the behaviour they've seen and reported in matches, or for the sheer amount of in-game clans bearing racist names and clan tags that still haven't been shut down by Riot, it's telling of how incompetent they are.

There's a difference between showing solidarity because you genuinely believe in a cause, and doing it just because you're a brand and want to pander to the followers of that cause for marketing. In Riot's case it's blatantly the latter. 

[At least Infinity Ward are honest enough to acknowledge such PR fuck-ups. Riot can't even fucking do that.](https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1268297976901849089)

Riot claim that they take negative behaviour very seriously, yet League of Legends is rife with racism, homophobia, sexism, ableism, extreme toxicity, inting and death threats and a lot of this has gone unpunished. Rather than look into player reports, Riot Games have wholly automated their report system to only target frequently reported players and punish them without investigation according to a penalty volcano that goes from 10 game chat restriction to permanent ban after 4 strikes.

This quantity-over-quality approach makes your report system rife for abuse and allows multiboxers or groups of players to effectively weaponise the report system against other players.

Blizzard did a very similar thing with the report system in Heroes of the Storm, except they changed it to a three-strikes system and had no leniency for periods of good behaviour built in either. Meaning if you got a 14 day suspension, were well behaved for two years then got hit with another restriction, GG your account. **And that was the main reason HotS died.**

Just look at all the people who have been unfairly suspended or permanently banned from League of Legends by the game's shitty automated report system, only to have Riot Customer Support uphold the ban because of banal ""sarcastic remarks.""

The punishment must fit the crime, and if you side with Riot and think that a player deserves to be permanently banned from a game which they likely sank thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars into, over the fact that they typed ""nice healing"" sarcastically to somebody not pulling their weight in a Ranked match, then you're just as scummy as them.",1591883516,1,1591879916.0

5,DanBalls,"About your comments:

""The RTS genre is basically dead"" is simply false. There are tons of new RTS games coming out all the time. If anything, that comment just reinforces how great Starcraft II is (since you're basically saying nothing of note has come out in the genre since). That said, I have heard the Warcraft III remaster is pretty terrible (haven't played it myself), so we could probably agree on that one.

""Hearthstone is the worst p2w piece of shit 'game' ever made and has done tons of damage to gaming as a whole."" I agree that P2W sucks and that Hearthstone has a problem with it, but CCGs have ALWAYS been P2W. I'd say MTG should probably shoulder most of the blame there. It is ridiculous how little you get for your money in Hearthstone and they have been slowly making it somewhat better, but set aside the economics of it and you have a really fun evolution (mostly streamlining) of MTG that is getting constant updates (including Battlegrounds, which, while billed as a ""mode,"" is practically and entirely different game) and holds a huge, mostly content player base.

""Diablo 3 was a massive disappointment"" 
Agreed, although Reaper of Souls and patches have fixed a lot of the problems D3 had on launch, D3 still lacks when it comes to replayability because of the team's design choices. That said, I still don't think it's a ""shit"" game... just not the Diablo I wanted. (Fingers crossed for D4.)

""Heroes of the Storm was a failure and they totally abandoned it."" Yes and no. It definitely didn't succeed the way they wanted it to, but it actually did evolve the genre in some pretty cool ways: different maps, objective based gameplay, team leveling, no last hitting, etc.. I know a lot of people hate these things, and that's fine, but I think it's cool they put their own spin on the genre instead of just copying what was already out there. I had fun playing for a while. Also, they're still constantly updating the game and they just released a new hero (Mei). I get your sentiment, but it's unfair to say they ""totally abandoned it."" That's just not true.

9,Clbull,"Sure. Here's a list of grievances that a lot of people had with Blizzard in the past few years:

* Heroes of the Storm (late 2018)  - After many lies and false promises about the game and its competitive scene's continuation, Blizzard abruptly cut the Heroes Global Championship (HGC) and moved most of the Heroes of the Storm development team to other projects in late 2018, effectively killing the game. A lot of stakeholders who were invested in the HGC ecosystem were screwed over by this announcement.

* Warlords of Draenor (late 2014) - Abilities and stats were pruned out of the game, lots of cut content, really stupid time travel story, only two raid tiers, only 8 dungeons, a content drought where no new content was released for over 15 months, final boss was recycled from a Burning Crusade raid six years prior, etc.

* Nostalrius (2016) - In 2016, Blizzard's legal team sent a cease and desist letter to the operators of Nostalrius, a Vanilla WoW private server that gained popularity due to the shittyness of WoD. This led to a huge backlash and a 240,000+ strong Change.org petition to introduce an official Vanilla WoW server. To Blizzard's credit, we got WoW Classic as a direct result of this campaign.

* Battle for Azeroth (2018 - 2020) - This expansion is generally hated for its shitty story, more ability pruning, poor writing of characters like Sylvanas Windrunner and how much of a downgrade the Azerite system was compared to the Artifact Weapons players got in the last expansion. The only reason it's not more hated than WoD is because Blizzard actually supported it with content.

* Diablo Immortal (2018) - Blizzard teased a huge Diablo announcement for Blizzcon 2018, only for this announcement to be a mobile game. The tone-deaf nature of the announcement and how Wyatt Cheng basically ridiculed the audience that booed him for not having phones is hilarious.

* Hearthstone Grandmasters (late 2019) - Blizzard issued a twelve month ban towards a competitive Hearthstone player and rescinded his $10,000 prize winnings, all because he spoke out in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong during a winners interview and pissed off the Chinese government. This led to a huge backlash and an ongoing boycott against Blizzard. Blizzard's blatant pandering to the CCP was so bad that the account deletion request page on the bnet website was down for several days.

* WarCraft III Reforged (2020) - WC3R is overall a downgrade compared to the original game. The remastered graphics are buggy, the balance of the Reign of Chaos campaign is broken by having TFT rulesets introduced, promised revamped cutscenes were never delivered which resulted in a case of false advertising, and automated tournaments were completely cut from the game. The worst part is that Blizzard forced the update on everybody who owned WC3 so you couldn't even play the original version of the game anymore.

what that means is wow is going to continue being written poorly, where the writers change the lore/history of warcraft to fit their terrible stories rather than writing stories that fit the established lore/history of warcraft

what that means for expansions: the smaller, zones stories will remain really good as they have been even as far back as WoD/MoP, but the overarching story of the expansion will be garbage as it has been in BFA, WoD, parts of legion and looking to be the same case for Shadowlands. It seems like the current writers can only handle small or self-contained stories and struggle with one that spans expansions, has to use old lore, setting up things for future and such.

And then the stuff they've retconned from previous expansions such as Chronicle volumes suddenly not being the definitive warcraft lore book (not even a year had passed since the final volume and they retconned that), completely changing Sylvanus's history from post-wrath, changing things about the naaru/light to suit their dumb ""everything is evil/grey"" narrative and so on",1593951112,1,1593947512.0

There's a difference between showing solidarity because you genuinely believe in a cause, and doing it just because you're a brand and want to pander to the followers of that cause for marketing. In Riot's case it's blatantly the latter. 

[At least Infinity Ward are honest enough to acknowledge such PR fuck-ups. Riot can't even fucking do that.](https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1268297976901849089)

Riot claim that they take negative behaviour very seriously, yet League of Legends is rife with racism, homophobia, sexism, ableism, extreme toxicity, inting and death threats and a lot of this has gone unpunished. Rather than look into player reports, Riot Games have wholly automated their report system to only target frequently reported players and punish them without investigation according to a penalty volcano that goes from 10 game chat restriction to permanent ban after 4 strikes.

This quantity-over-quality approach makes your report system rife for abuse and allows multiboxers or groups of players to effectively weaponise the report system against other players.

Blizzard did a very similar thing with the report system in Heroes of the Storm, except they changed it to a three-strikes system and had no leniency for periods of good behaviour built in either. Meaning if you got a 14 day suspension, were well behaved for two years then got hit with another restriction, GG your account. **And that was the main reason HotS died.**

Just look at all the people who have been unfairly suspended or permanently banned from League of Legends by the game's shitty automated report system, only to have Riot Customer Support uphold the ban because of banal ""sarcastic remarks.""

The punishment must fit the crime, and if you side with Riot and think that a player deserves to be permanently banned from a game which they likely sank thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars into, over the fact that they typed ""nice healing"" sarcastically to somebody not pulling their weight in a Ranked match, then you're just as scummy as them.",1591883516,1,1591879916.0

""The RTS genre is basically dead"" is simply false. There are tons of new RTS games coming out all the time. If anything, that comment just reinforces how great Starcraft II is (since you're basically saying nothing of note has come out in the genre since). That said, I have heard the Warcraft III remaster is pretty terrible (haven't played it myself), so we could probably agree on that one.

""Hearthstone is the worst p2w piece of shit 'game' ever made and has done tons of damage to gaming as a whole."" I agree that P2W sucks and that Hearthstone has a problem with it, but CCGs have ALWAYS been P2W. I'd say MTG should probably shoulder most of the blame there. It is ridiculous how little you get for your money in Hearthstone and they have been slowly making it somewhat better, but set aside the economics of it and you have a really fun evolution (mostly streamlining) of MTG that is getting constant updates (including Battlegrounds, which, while billed as a ""mode,"" is practically and entirely different game) and holds a huge, mostly content player base.

""Diablo 3 was a massive disappointment"" 
Agreed, although Reaper of Souls and patches have fixed a lot of the problems D3 had on launch, D3 still lacks when it comes to replayability because of the team's design choices. That said, I still don't think it's a ""shit"" game... just not the Diablo I wanted. (Fingers crossed for D4.)

""Heroes of the Storm was a failure and they totally abandoned it."" Yes and no. It definitely didn't succeed the way they wanted it to, but it actually did evolve the genre in some pretty cool ways: different maps, objective based gameplay, team leveling, no last hitting, etc..

It is ridiculous how little you get for your money in Hearthstone and they have been slowly making it somewhat better, but set aside the economics of it and you have a really fun evolution (mostly streamlining) of MTG that is getting constant updates (including Battlegrounds, which, while billed as a ""mode,"" is practically and entirely different game) and holds a huge, mostly content player base.

""Diablo 3 was a massive disappointment"" 
Agreed, although Reaper of Souls and patches have fixed a lot of the problems D3 had on launch, D3 still lacks when it comes to replayability because of the team's design choices. That said, I still don't think it's a ""shit"" game... just not the Diablo I wanted. (Fingers crossed for D4.)

""Heroes of the Storm was a failure and they totally abandoned it."" Yes and no. It definitely didn't succeed the way they wanted it to, but it actually did evolve the genre in some pretty cool ways: different maps, objective based gameplay, team leveling, no last hitting, etc.. I know a lot of people hate these things, and that's fine, but I think it's cool they put their own spin on the genre instead of just copying what was already out there. I had fun playing for a while. Also, they're still constantly updating the game and they just released a new hero (Mei). I get your sentiment, but it's unfair to say they ""totally abandoned it."" That's just not true.

I get your Overwatch comment. Not everyone is gonna love it. I personally don't play much anymore, but judging it by practically any metric, it's a very good game.",1592918268,1,1592914668.0

Riot claim that they take negative behaviour very seriously, yet League of Legends is rife with racism, homophobia, sexism, ableism, extreme toxicity, inting and death threats and a lot of this has gone unpunished. Rather than look into player reports, Riot Games have wholly automated their report system to only target frequently reported players and punish them without investigation according to a penalty volcano that goes from 10 game chat restriction to permanent ban after 4 strikes.

This quantity-over-quality approach makes your report system rife for abuse and allows multiboxers or groups of players to effectively weaponise the report system against other players.

Blizzard did a very similar thing with the report system in Heroes of the Storm, except they changed it to a three-strikes system and had no leniency for periods of good behaviour built in either. Meaning if you got a 14 day suspension, were well behaved for two years then got hit with another restriction, GG your account. **And that was the main reason HotS died.**

4,SchmidlerOnTheRoof,"&gt; As a software engineer, or anyone with more than 2 braincells can tell you, any software that runs, at all, has a statistical impact on the system. The question is just how big it is.

No, unless you mean in the absolute most pedantic sense? As a random example if you have an application bottle-necked by a some lengthy operation, then including another very quick operation that runs simultaneously in another thread will *realistically* not cause your process to complete any slower (maybe some micro-second scale overhead from spawning a thread). 

If the impact is imperceptibly small then it is irrelevant. If Vanguard has a *statistically significant effect*, IE one that is even measurable by the user, then that is an unfortunate drawback of the application. Hence I would indeed like to see the numbers to see if this actually a relevant concern.

&gt; Maybe read my comment again, im not even talking about multiplayer games. Like did you even read it at all?

You *specifically* said ""Those would now be affected by Vanguard"". For those applications to be affected by Vanguard, *Valorant would have to be running*. I then immediately demonstrated how Vanguard is not policing my computer for Cheat Engine (or similar) while Valorant is not running. So no, Vanguard *will not* affect that software so long as you aren't playing Valorant at the same time. (Enormous ask, I know /s)

&gt; You can run League of Legens, Smite and Heroes of the storm, all three, without any hassle while having not only cheat engine open bu manipulating a fourth process actively.

Good for them.

&gt; That Valorant doesnt even open when cheat engine is open is ridiculous and already speaks of a gross oversight of privileges.

What do you mean by privileges in this context? You don't need to be a privileged process to detect when cheat engine is open. 

&gt; For anyone in the back with a clear lack of reading comprehension: The whole argument is not about Vanguard blocking cheats in Valorant, its about Vanguard affecting the whole system while Valorant is running and even when its not.

Of course Vanguard affects the system while Valorant is running, that is literally its job. You have not demonstrated anywhere, at all, that Vanguard is ""affecting the whole system"" while Valorant isn't running. Quite a significant claim to be making *without any citations*. You'd never do that would you?

&gt; You were stating something as fact without delivering any kind of proof, therefore its your responsibility to prove what you are saying is true. I know its wrong, and you cant prove a non-existent which any software engineer learns in the first semester of university and should know...

Fucking ironic. ""if you want to cheat its actually quite easy to circumvent"" Where is your citation for this claim? *I'll wait*, you ass.

&gt;&gt; This is good for stopping cheaters because a common way to bypass anti-cheat systems is to load cheats before the anti-cheat system starts and either modify system components to contain the cheat or to have the cheat tamper with the anti-cheat system as it loads. Running the driver at system startup time makes this significantly more difficult.

&gt;Thats not a source dude, its a fucking reddit comment from Riot defending their invasive anti-cheat with again, no quoted sources to back up the claim.

Which part of it do you need a source for? It's purely fucking logic. If Riot said the sky was blue would you demand a source? Just because a statement is made by someone with an inherent bias does not mean the claim is inherently false. The statement stands on its own. I provided Riot's justification, if you have a logical problem with that justification then please share your specific concern. 

&gt; You gave me a hypothetical thats wrong too

Which hypothetical are you referring to?

I'm sorry that you can't open Valorant, Dragon Age, and Cheat Engine at the same time. You are probably the only person on the planet that has this issue. And if that's really the case then it's too bad for you, but adhering to your personal preference is not worth sacrificing the integrity of the game, even slightly, for the millions of other players.",1596597364,1,1596593764.0

I am too, what a coincidence!

&gt;You're extremely confident about things you have just demonstrated to lack quite a bit of knowledge on.

Right back at ya.

&gt;If Vanguard has a statistically significant effect on the performance of other software, that's unfortunate. I'd like to see the numbers.

As a software engineer, or anyone with more than 2 braincells can tell you, any software that runs, at all, has a statistical impact on the system. The question is just how big it is.

But any impact is greater than no impact, and this is not about how high its impact is, but that its unnecessarily there in the first place.

&gt;I'm struggling to come up with a legitimate reason you would ever be reading or modifying the memory of a multiplayer game except to cheat or to develop cheats. 

Maybe read my comment again, im not even talking about multiplayer games. Like did you even read it at all?

&gt;Don't run cheat engine and Valorant at the same time. Pretty sure every other anti-cheat on the market also won't let you launch their games when you have cheat engine open. Vanguard doesn't ban you or even stop you from using cheat engine when Valorant isn't running. I just tested, game doesn't open when cheat engine is open. Closed cheat engine and then the game opened just fine. Not banned, no side effects. 

This was an example for how shitty Vanguard is, you can have easy-anti-cheat or the battle-eye process running on the respective multiplayer games and still use cheat engine on another process without any impact. This holds true for the majority of anti cheat software, since they only monitor code and file manipulation of the running process they are overlooking.

You can run League of Legens, Smite and Heroes of the storm, all three, without any hassle while having not only cheat engine open bu manipulating a fourth process actively.

That Valorant doesnt even open when cheat engine is open is ridiculous and already speaks of a gross oversight of privileges.

&gt;Valorant isn't a single player game. Wth is the point of this sentence? 

For anyone in the back with a clear lack of reading comprehension: The whole argument is not about Vanguard blocking cheats in Valorant, its about Vanguard affecting the whole system while Valorant is running and even when its not. Its way too invasive to be accepted by consumers without question, which is why people are questioning it...

&gt;The fact that you just said this throws your entire argument into the garbage. Maybe do some actual research before parroting whatever YouTube reaction farmer you got your outrage news from? I even literally gave you an example of just one reason for this in my previous comment, did you actually read it? 

Haha dude asking for citing, right after you did the same for my response to your claim throws my argument? What are you, 5?

It also is on an entirely different engine, with giant mechs, and a totally different game that was free from the burden of being a sequel. I love titanfall but that's not comparable.

&gt;So what you're saying is that you can't handle any mechanical complexity beyond ""point rifle at the other guy""?

First off I play a wide variety of shooters ranging from quake to halo to cod to battlefield to rising storm, etc etc. Don't be a dumbass.

Added movement doesn't always equal added complexity. Mashing the jetpack button when you got shot didn't add any thing to cod and they way they introduced heroes just resulted in more random one shot deaths. 

&gt;Battlefield hasn't been good since BF4, and BF4 offers enough bonkers action that it doesn't need to be tactical. CoD does not offer bonkers action; the closest it gets is Ground War, which is now a Battlefield ripoff but shittier because the maps are too cluttered and the vehicles aren't powerful enough.

lol okay. All I'm hearing is ""STOP LIKING WHAT I DON'T LIKE YOU'RE STUPID""

I think it's always been that way, the 90s weren't special. 

Earlier in the 90s, Street Fighter 2 becomes a blockbuster hit and suddenly everyone starts making fighting games, until then a very niche genre. Mortal Kombat, Virtua Fighter, Samurai Shodown, Eternal Champions, etc all debuted out within the next year or two specifically to ride the SF2 wave, Soul Edge/Blade (precursor to Soul Calibur), Dead or Alive and Marvel vs Capcom (debuting as X-Men vs Street Fighter) a little later.

Doom comes out in the mid-90s and suddenly EVERYONE is making what they call ""Doom clones"" (before the term FPS existed). 18 months later they make up half the bestseller list. The late 90s is practically defined by the FPS craze: Quake, Half-Life, GoldenEye, Unreal, Duke Nukem 3D, Turok, Starsiege Tribes, etc all within a pretty short timeframe as the trend takes the industry by storm.

Then the WW2 shooter craze. Medal of Honor in '99 starts it, huge huge hit, 8 sequels within 5 years, Hidden &amp; Dangerous the same year. Over the next few years you get Battlefield 1942, a bunch of Call of Duties, the revival of the Wolfenstein franchise, Day of Defeat, Operation Green Panther, Elite Forces WW2, D-Day, Deadly Dozen, IL-2 Sturmovik, Blitzkrieg, Hearts of Iron... Company of Heroes etc at the tail end. At the tail end of the 90s/start of the 00s it was WW2 everywhere.

There was an RTS craze in the late 90s too, not quite so big as the others, but at least as big as Hearthstone-likes now, IMO. Warcraft, Starcraft, Command &amp; Conquer, Warlords Battlecry, Total Annihilation, and Age of Empires (plus the RTS-adjacent Civilization) all being hits around the same time made tons of rivals push for the genre and even made them release RTS ports for home consoles with usually terrible results.

Survival horror, too. Resident Evil and Clock Tower dropping at the same time started a fad and we got a flood of imitators, some good (Silent Hill, Parasite Eve, Dino Crisis, Fatal Frame) but plenty terrible.

And the skating and extreme sports craze where we got two hundred games blatantly modeled on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. In addition to a dozen Tony Hawk games, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX, Amped, Aggressive Inline, Jet Set Radio, SSX (Tricky), BMX XXX, etc.",1597098370,1,1597094770.0

I matured, thank god, but still found myself getting angry and debating with players who thought I wasn't 'playing that character the right way' and so on.

I think it was in my mid twenties, after playing League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm, when I finally decided it wasn't for me. All the complaining, people who think you should play a certain way, etc. and the immature attitudes that I used to have myself as a young teenager. I think, too, that I stopped caring about 'being the best' or hitting a certain rank and started caring more about being able to have a novel experience or being able to be creative in a game.

They may have hit record profits, but Blizzard's revenues have been steadily falling. The record profits were only because they had been tightening their belt and cutting expenses everywhere in their studio. And as revenues continued to fall, they didn't need 3,000 employees to manage their product line up anymore. If they waited till they were running a loss and were bankrupt, they wouldn't be firing one third of their company, they'd be firing everyone.

36,Blenderhead36,"Really depends on the game and the default communications methods.  I've been a Heroes of the Storm nerd for coming up on five years, and a big part of why is that they built a robust ping system with the idea that you can turn off chat and still communicate effectively with your team.  Apex Legends built a very similar system.  It's been my experience that games that make voice chat easy are generally less toxic, but I have a very masculine voice; a female friend of mine has reported very different experiences with voice chat.

I also bias more towards games with shorter match times.  A game of HotS is 20-30 minutes, compared to other MOBAs clocking in closer to 45-60.  If I have a toolbox on my team, I'm done with them in less time than an episode of TV show.  This also means that if I have two hours to relax tonight, a toolbox is only going to get a shot at 20-25% of my gaming time, whereas a night of LoL could very realistic be ruined by two bad experiences.",1602463709,1,1602460109.0

Ambitious isn't even the word I'd use for them either. Arrogant and deluded would be terms that I think fit their mindset these days when it comes to how they view esports and their titles.

It's funny that I actually think Heroes of the Storm was in a better position overall in terms of health back when they weren't pushing esports.

Overwatch obviously was more popular on twitch, but like every game from Blizzard that initial excitement and creativity gets gutted or lost focus of.

Ironically, HotS is probably the most player-friendly game in Blizzard's launcher now.  Since the suits have basically given up on it, it doesn't have nearly as much of the brutal monetization as the likes of Hearthstone.

It used to be a slower paced, more strategic MOBA with long fights but still short match lengths. For card game aficionados, it was kind of the Gwent of MOBAs, complete with bluffing and locking down opponents. Then Blizzard changed it so burst damage was key, presumably to make the game more exciting for streaming, and began tweaking existing heroes and releasing new heroes around the new burst meta, digging the hole deeper and deeper. Unfortunately in the process, the game lost its strategy layer and it became all about twitch reflexes. I know Blizzard tends to ruin the majority of their games over time, but HotS in particular has always been the one that bummed me out the most.

11,Maelstrom52,"So, I was actually a huge believer in the systems marketed in WD:L.  In my mind, I envisioned a much broader array of skills, perks, and personality quirks that I would use to create a vibrant and colorful motley crew of well-intentioned misfits who would all become the unlikely heroes of a dystopian London.  And to be totally honest, I felt like I was definitely able to do this though I agree with the complain in the video that it all felt a tad too generic.  While not quite as assorted an colorful as I would have hoped, there's certainly a massive difference between doing a mission as a hitman as opposed to hacker.  To be sure, I like the game a lot more than Errant Signal appears to, but I also think his criticism is well-deserved. That said, whereas his primary complaint seems to focus on the absence of creating a more personality-driven narrative, I think my main criticism was more the lost potential of world-building that could be done with this mechanic.  

I had hoped that depending on who you recruited, you could help shape the world of WD:L and manipulate systems that could be used to gain leverage from a gameplay perspective or potentially open up different mission types.  For example, recruiting a doctor might give me access to a database of patients who were in dire need of medicine that was overly priced making unavailable for most people.  This would mean that I could either steal the medicine myself and perhaps send it to a free clinic.  Or, if I wanted to go a more complex, but permanent route, I could possibly either recruit or blackmail a charge master at the hospital to force them to lower the prices, but this would require more steps to solve.  Instead, recruiting a doctor means that I can simply enter a hospital without being harassed by security for a slightly longer than a non-doctor.

Here's another scenario that might have added an additional layer of complexity to mission planning:  Imagine that I have an upcoming mission that takes place in a construction site.  If I were to recruit or coerce 5 construction workers or a union rep, I could convince them to go on strike which would force the workers out of the building, which I could use to my advantage for the mission.  Instead, recruiting a construction worker simply gives me access to a drone and allows me to wander around without being harassed by the security offices as much. One of my favorite aspects of Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, was that with enough time and planning you effectively recruit every single Orc captain to your cause, so that when you finally did storm the castle, all of the captains would be betrayers and it was a simply jaunt over to the orc leader.  It felt like I had masterminded the entire thing, and while it took a SUPER long time to do, you felt really rewarded when it all came together.

I never expected the individual characters to have as much personality as they did in Watch_Dogs 2, but I would have gladly settled for more world manipulation.  This is where the bulk of my criticism of the game comes from.",1607387693,1,1607384093.0

2,zeromussc,"Activision Blizzard is all in on overwatch and if it wasn't for the fact WoW prints money they'd have scaled that back too.

Hearthstone is getting consistent support but it's nothing mind blowing for the community. It's also basically a Warcraft title.

If Diablo 4 isn't earth shattering then I think they'll probably can that IP too.

WC3 reforged is still broken, SC is barely going. Heroes of the Storm is on life support too. Even OW has a super delayed OW2 release. 

The underlying passion for the games seems to have left and I think Blizzard lost a lot of what made them Blizzard years ago. Most of the original leaders have left and now there are new studios lead by those same people that got started just last year. 

The only franchise left that gets any work I care at all about is Overwatch. I like playing hearthstone but it's not exactly a deeply entrenched lore based community I just like card games. And even overwatch is a rare play for me since its barely had anything done to it in a long while. The promise of OW2 being the refresh seems like a promise they'll never deliver on.

Activision is probably the reason too. Look at how different post Activision Bungie and Destiny 2 are for example. 

If they do something with StarCraft that would be great. But I know they've given up on RTS and strategy games and that's disappointing. They were the best dev for those genres. At least fix reforged ya know?",1613012811,9,1613009211.0

I play a lot of Overwatch and contrast with others believe, the game is neither ""dead"" like people think nor toxic to th point of unplayable. Most of the games are just chilled. I recommend it because it is easy to get in and fun enough to occupy my time.",1613289052,1,1613285452.0
7,zeromussc,"I definitely meant blizzard post acti-blizz merger. 

I dont mean that there is zero passion, but it seems like old blizzard took people who were passionate about titles and empowered them to make them great and push them into the world. 

Newer blizzard seems like it only wants to let things that are for sure going to make lots of money then allow passionate people to work on it. 

All the RTS and strategy people left blizzard because the company no longer believed in the genre writ large. Starcraft, Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm - all of it presumed to be a low revenue genre and as a result no green light to move forward on anything new. 

Its why we see some of the people who were instrumental on that side of the Blizzard business go off to make their own studios. 

The ethos of the company has changed since the Activision merger. I believe old blizzard would have never let reforged release in the way it did and would have fixed it by now. I also don't think old blizzard would have done the ""you all have phones"" Diablo fiasco, and I think old Blizzard would have let people with mountains of experience prototype for new strategy games - seeing as how Blizzard remains synonymous with strategy as a genre in gaming.",1613055653,1,1613052053.0

10,Blenderhead36,"Something that I've come to realize recently is that every game I've ever played that had an esports push was worse off for it.

Esports players tend to be the most toxic because they experience small issues more often (and in most games, they're men under 25). Most games aren't prepared to have dedicated teams playing for 60 hours a week, learning all the little corner cases and oddities. And lastly, it turns out that some game elements are essentially impossible to balance in a way that makes  them functional a 30-year-old schlub jamming his fourth game of the week after work on Thursday without being ludicrously overpowered in the hands of a 21-year-old pro playing his 300th ranked match this week.

What? My link is lifetime sales of Diablo 3 which includes Reaper of Souls. But whatever, I guess by your definition the 3rd best selling PC game of all time wasn't a success lmao. And from your article, the part that you conveniently left out 

&gt; Reportedly, Blizzard Entertainment was reluctant to commit to a second expansion because Diablo III lacks a steady revenue stream (aside from its Asian, free to play model), whereas most of its other games involve either a subscription fee (e.g. World of Warcraft) or microtransactions (e.g. Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm), therefore the game has low profitability compared to other Blizzard games in most regions (Asia being a notable exception).[2]

14,ShempWafflesSuxCock,"&gt; The component that ends up missing: adrenaline. There's no tension. Nothing ever seems exciting because it's always ramped up. The game becomes bland.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is why games like PubG came in and carved away the playerbase from those games. They offered something the devs at DICE thought was the enemy: a slower pace, more methodical and strategic gameplay.

Bingo. A part of a different genre, but this is one of the reasons Heroes of the Storm had such a hard time taking off in the e-sports realm; the game is teamfights after teamfights with little to no downtime, which is exhausting to watch.

When everything is cranked up to 11 all the time, nothing really feels like it is. 

This, with plenty of blatant headshotting only cheaters and ridiculous chat filters that made even simple things to talk about impossible really bummed the community out.

Other than that, I think it is the best battlefield to date. It is just draining to play for long. The tech and gun play was there and the changes to balance medics were definitely necessary. Squad revives were a nice addition, but they never put in dragging downed teammates to cover as advertised and grand operations is a step down, suprisingly, from BF1s amazing operations game mode.",1613066911,1,1613063311.0

17,ArcaneSyntax,"Ill take actually challenging 5 man content over repeating the same dungeon content for 6 years, especially when the challenge is trivial.

You know wow tried the no trash thing right? Back in 2009. People largely hated it. Turns out trash is actually good for the longevity of the raid, it's downtime, a way for players to ease some tension after a tough encounter.

Lack of trash isn't the only problem i have though, its the fact that each boss exists in its own little pocket dimension completely isolated. The raids arent supposed to actual physical spaces in FFXIV.

One of my favorite moments in World of Warcraft is in Antorus, the last raid from Legion. After defeating the first 8 bosses you take a teleporter an ancinet titan facility. It's a long hallway thats got some trash then opens up into a boss room and then another hallway with Aggramar at the end. When you first arrive you can literally see him, like 800 yards away, a pair of glowing orange eyes in a sea of darkness. This moment is impossible in any challenging sense in FFXIV.

When i do a raid i dont just want to kill bosses, i want to kick in the door and make my way through a gothic castle. I want to storm a titan facility and kill an old god. I want to enter an otherworldly plane and kill a corrupting force. I want to seige a castle and take the fight all the way to the frozen throne where a guy in a pointy helmet sits.",1614346023,0,1614342423.0

2,6890,"That's just because its what people demand. And though its probably a matter of opinion, yeah I think gamers are entitled and expect too much.

Look at a game like Starcraft Brood Wars or CS1.6 which, in their prime, had very little patching yet stayed popular and competitive with a shifting meta based only around what the players brought to the game.

It can be done, I just don't think people are willing to accept it anymore.

In a side-rant, I hate that everything has to meta shift so often. Its the primary reason why I don't go back to a lot of games anymore and prefer to try new things. I used to play Heroes of the Storm fairly frequently and tried getting back into it with a couple friends who never quit and I hated it. Not only were there *so many new elements* to the game, but they took the things I *thought* I knew and changed them with reworks. So now, not only am I trying to learn new mechanics, I'm needing to forget and ignore intuition to stay competitive.

I tried Rainbow6 couple years ago and trying to jump into a mature game with a huge learning curve also kinda killed my desire to get into it. Basically, you need to invest a couple hundred hours in the game (or watching streams/reading) *just* to learn standard meta and quirks of each map/operator. CS has a lot of the same quirks, but at least the game doesn't upend itself multiple times a year and force you to re-learn and re-shift your understanding of the game.

Apex Legends devs have said that in order to remain relevent in a live service market they need to be *constantly* putting out new content and you can see that even at the rate they go, people on the subreddit still don't think its enough. But if they paused long enough to do a bunch of maintenance on the game the fan base would cry bloody murder over lack of new content.",1615930174,1,1615926574.0

Diablo III

Hearthstone

Heroes of the Storm

Overwatch

That's it. I'd argue that SC2, Hearthstone, and Overwatch were all excellent games when they released, and I really like where Diablo 3 ended up after the expansion.

5,MildlyInsaneOwl,"I... have no clue what you're saying? Yes, Binding of Isaac is a roguelike, and most players I've talked to refer to it as such. Call of Duty isn't called a ""Doomclone"", it's called an ""FPS"" game, a term that we've used ever since other games besides Doom became popular in the genre. Both are examples of genre names, though, and neither have any relationship whatsoever to an acronym having two possible meanings (TF2 vs TF2).

An actually *related* example would be ""HotS"" meaning either ""Heart of the Swarm"" or ""Heroes of the Storm"", two separate games by Blizzard that managed to both have the exact same acronym. I still don't think this supports the point you're trying to make, though (which seems to be ""TF2 could mean Titanfall 2 because words change""), because ""SC2"" was usually used as the acronym to refer to Starcraft 2 and its expansions, and the rest was generally clear from context since the games are in different genres.

Finally, the parent poster had already addressed ""words change"" as an argument by pointing out that Team Fortress 2 has generally had the larger playerbase. Titanfall 2 is a great game that failed to capture a large audience, and once the initial launch hype died down it fell below the numbers of Team Fortress 2, which is on a larger platform and also free-to-play. I don't know how you'd argue that the newer, less-popular game is a real contender for dethroning the current holder of the ""TF2"" acronym.",1615586580,1,1615582980.0

StarCraft -- officially dead. No new content aside from competitive balance updates.

This one is especially painful.)

Heroes of the Storm -- unofficially dead. Still makes them money from cosmetics but the pro scene is laughable and the ranked queue times are like 1 hour. Unplayable aside from quickmatch.

Diablo -- 4. Alive and well. Yaaaay :/

WarCraft Reforged -- Probably one of the top 10 worst remakes/remasters of all time.

This is like the modern spiritual successor to Assassins Creed II that I didn’t know how much I needed. Story/storytelling above and beyond what I expected, gameplay some of the best I’ve ever played and maybe my personal favorite, the streamlining of so many elements present in games and specifically open world games was eye opening, art like wow I don’t even think I need to discuss cause one second of looking at it and you can tell how profound the art style is especially because it’s not as photorealistic as some games in the last 2 years but it makes up for it with having the most beautiful semi realistic game I’ve ever seen, great soundtrack/ audio in general.

17,6890,"That's just because its what people demand. And though its probably a matter of opinion, yeah I think gamers are entitled and expect too much.

Look at a game like Starcraft Brood Wars or CS1.6 which, in their prime, had very little patching yet stayed popular and competitive with a shifting meta based only around what the players brought to the game.

It can be done, I just don't think people are willing to accept it anymore.

In a side-rant, I hate that everything has to meta shift so often. Its the primary reason why I don't go back to a lot of games anymore and prefer to try new things. I used to play Heroes of the Storm fairly frequently and tried getting back into it with a couple friends who never quit and I hated it. Not only were there *so many new elements* to the game, but they took the things I *thought* I knew and changed them with reworks. So now, not only am I trying to learn new mechanics, I'm needing to forget and ignore intuition to stay competitive.

I tried Rainbow6 couple years ago and trying to jump into a mature game with a huge learning curve also kinda killed my desire to get into it. Basically, you need to invest a couple hundred hours in the game (or watching streams/reading) *just* to learn standard meta and quirks of each map/operator. CS has a lot of the same quirks, but at least the game doesn't upend itself multiple times a year and force you to re-learn and re-shift your understanding of the game.

Apex Legends devs have said that in order to remain relevent in a live service market they need to be *constantly* putting out new content and you can see that even at the rate they go, people on the subreddit still don't think its enough.

2,jacenat,"I realize /u/Prudent-Resist3408 originally specified only ""good games"", but the implicit ""good new Blizzard games"" is easily inferrable through the OP. So with that:

&gt; Diablo Immortal and Diablo 2 Resurrected are getting preeeetty good attention during prerelease.

Diablo Immortal was an existing Netease mobile game, branded with Diablo. They might have modified it, but the core will largely remain the same. I'd be shocked if it didn't. So neither is it a new game, nor is it good. The original game got traction in Asia because gacha games are a cultural thing there. But not over here in the West. It can even be a good gacha game. Still won't track well with what we currently know as a ""good"" Blizzard game.

Diablo2 Res is literally an old game with a new skin. Yes, SC:BW remaster was good. No, War3:Ref was not good. Yes, D2R might be good. None of them are new. Blizzard will run out of them quickly. Blizzard produced the following big games since 1994:

* Warcraft
* Warcraft II
* Diablo
* Starcraft
* Diablo II
* Warcraft III
* World of Warcraft
* Starcraft II (WoL, RotS, LotV)
* Diablo III
* Hearthstone
* Heroes of the Storm
* Overwatch

All up to and including WoW have gotten (or will soon get) remasters and/or re-releases.

Starcraft II was designed as ""modern"" game from the ground and had active development (and still has), so probably won't get re-released any time soon or maybe ever.

Diablo III was designed as a ""modern"" game as SC II. Also won't get a re-release soon or mayb ever.

Hearthstone is actually a live game that will have trouble being re-released ever. Also, Hearthstone is the first game that has no story whatsoever and is a ""meta"" game. It uses stories and story elements of other games without contributing anything new. Such games usually do not create huge waves of nostalgia and if they create nostalgia, they fizzle quicker.

Heroes of the Storm is a live game that is effectively on long term live support. It would maybe be better to shut it down if you want to re-release it at any point in the future. By keeping it up, players can get their fix without actually having to put funds into it. Making the incentive for Blizzard to actually look at the game basically 0.

Overwatch is getting Overwatch 2. And we all hope it has something substantially new. Either it needs to go the way Fortnite and CoD Warzone went (not sure the playbase will like it) or have something else. If it's just more of the same, it will not make a big enough splash to justify so many resources over such a long time. Also it won't be re-released ever. Just as with other team shooters, it needs to try to stay afloat perpetually, or it will die.

So what are the 2000+ new devs working on? Stuff like Diablo Immortal. The goal currently is to find gaming fads (in new markets) and slap on Blizzards branding in an effort to drive these players back to existing core games (mostly, WoW, OW and Diablo). So I fully expect a new Warcraft game being in the work, but not being aimed at the classic blizzard crowd. It might be a really speced down version of WoW for groups up to 5 and heavy instancing (like Guildwars 1) for mobile platforms. And from there, players should migrate to the real WoW and it's cash shop.

Something similar might happen to Overwatch. Maybe even Starcraft. For anything truly **new** coming out of Blizzard, they would need to hire strong devs/narrators with a strong engineering core team and let them simmer for a bunch of years. I doubt they have either the people or the internal structure to support that. So the statement

&gt; No. And they won't anytime soon.

It is kind of crazy that the last new non-DLC game they released was Overwatch almost a full five years ago.  Before that they were (relatively) pumping out games with the StarCraft series, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm, and Hearthstone over a similar span.  It's like the period after they released World of Warcraft and went on cruise control while the money rolled in... but they forgot to start the new cash cow.",1620225292,6,1620221692.0

Starcraft is basically the only series on that list that feels abandoned right now.

That's not to say they've been making quality content or supporting their fans.  I don't blame Diablo or Overwatch fans for feeling frustrated by the long wait for sequels, Heroes of the Storm's already slowed down and it seems like it's only a matter of time before it stops getting updates completely, and plenty of WoW and Hearthstone fans have lost interest in those games (whether they just got tired of them or don't like the direction they've been going it).

There's so much variety available today, and it's all so accessible. FPS's, RPG's, Turn-based strategy games, and other genres common to 2007 (and most of the past) are still available/being released today. Many of those games are well designed, genuinely interesting, and bring something new to the table. Many more, aren't - but that was just as true back in the day as it is today.

On top of that, you've got things that are almost entirely new. Battle Royales still feel like they popped up only yesterday, as did Auto Battlers/Autochess/Pokemon Defense style games, designed-for-digital card games like Hearthstone and Eternal exploded in the early/mid 2010's, randomizer variants of old and new games have come up that test the player's ability to plan a route through a gameworld (or two - SMZ3) over mechanical skill checks, and so on. 

Finally, it's entirely possible to genuinely get a great experience from a game that literally costs nothing. DOTA2/League of Legends/Heroes of the Storm, Eternal/Hearthstone/Magic the Gathering: Arena, Fortnite, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Path of Exile... F2P games tend to get a bad rep in some circles, but no analog to them really existed back in the day, and it's *fantastic* that players always have at least that option.",1619394230,1,1619390630.0
9,yunghollow69,"I can not stress enough that the reason why blizzard is losing players has nothing to do with activision. Blizzard has historically been the slowest company on earth when it comes to A) new products and more importantly B) updating existing IPs.

Players just naturally move on because there is no reason to stay. Stuff like them being greedy, them being suck-ups to china, them getting memed for diablo immortal etc. all makes up for probably less than 1% of players they lost. The vast majority doesnt care. What they care about is playing something that is fun.

Would you play overwatch that even at the height of activity was barely updated or would you play fortnite? Or apex? 

Would you play heroes of the storm on life-support or play league of legends?

Would you play hearthstone or arena, or the game made by riot or maybe one of the free anime cardgames?

And so on. The answer of these questions keeps shifting away from the blizzard games simply because they arent properly supported. Fortnite is very different from OW sure, but both are shooters with one of them getting support by the devs while the other is abandoned.

Diablo 4 or OW 2 wont change anything unless blizzard finally changes its structure. Its 2021 and they are still taking 10 years to release a game that they then patch twice a year. This approach simply does not work anymore.",1620236484,1,1620232884.0

13,stufff,"&gt;The game had 3-5 hours of content (doing hours of MM on a slightly different “shoots stuff” character isn’t more content)

Game also had raids, danger rooms, etc. But it was an ARPG. The ""content"" was grinding for gear. You might as well dump the same criticism on Diablo or any number of other ARPGS. If you don't enjoy endlessly grinding for gear then it's not the kind of game for you, that doesn't make it bad. If you spent all your time in MM playing different ""shoots stuff"" characters that's on you; I mained She-Hulk and also had a lot of time into Storm, Scarlet Witch, and Cable, and they all played pretty differently.

&gt;literally thousands of dollars worth of things you could buy.

So... just like every other free to play game, and even most subscription or premium games now? The fact that there were cosmetics you *could* pay for is irrelevant to whether it was ""way way way overly monetized"" because you could unlock *all of the heroes* for free. You could also get cosmetics for free, though the process was fairly grindy and very RNG heavy; if you wanted a specific cosmetic you pretty much had to buy it... which is not unreasonable in a free to play game.

I played the game for *years* and probably didn't spend more than $30 on it. I paid for the She-Hulk team up, and She-Hulk when she was released as a hero as well as some She-Hulk cosmetics and inventory tab, because I'm a big She-Hulk fan. I also paid for some generic inventory tabs because I like hoarding. I could have easily played without ever dropping a cent on the game, and the little bit of money I did spend was a good value IMO.

Honestly, the game's monetization model (focus on inventory tabs and cosmetics) isn't that different from Path of Exile, which is generally regarded as the gold standard for free to play monetization.

BlizzCon 2018 was an absolute disaster for them. It was the official handing of the torch (publicly) from Morhaime to Brack, the downgrade of leadership (President and CEO to just President), the public shift from their existing playerbase to the potential Chinese market.",1620196165,14,1620192565.0
26,jacenat,"I realize /u/Prudent-Resist3408 originally specified only ""good games"", but the implicit ""good new Blizzard games"" is easily inferrable through the OP. So with that:

&gt; Diablo Immortal and Diablo 2 Resurrected are getting preeeetty good attention during prerelease.

Diablo Immortal was an existing Netease mobile game, branded with Diablo. They might have modified it, but the core will largely remain the same. I'd be shocked if it didn't. So neither is it a new game, nor is it good. The original game got traction in Asia because gacha games are a cultural thing there. But not over here in the West. It can even be a good gacha game. Still won't track well with what we currently know as a ""good"" Blizzard game.

Diablo2 Res is literally an old game with a new skin. Yes, SC:BW remaster was good. No, War3:Ref was not good. Yes, D2R might be good. None of them are new. Blizzard will run out of them quickly. Blizzard produced the following big games since 1994:

* Warcraft
* Warcraft II
* Diablo
* Starcraft
* Diablo II
* Warcraft III
* World of Warcraft
* Starcraft II (WoL, RotS, LotV)
* Diablo III
* Hearthstone
* Heroes of the Storm
* Overwatch

All up to and including WoW have gotten (or will soon get) remasters and/or re-releases.

Starcraft II was designed as ""modern"" game from the ground and had active development (and still has), so probably won't get re-released any time soon or maybe ever.

Diablo III was designed as a ""modern"" game as SC II. Also won't get a re-release soon or mayb ever.

Hearthstone is actually a live game that will have trouble being re-released ever. Also, Hearthstone is the first game that has no story whatsoever and is a ""meta"" game. It uses stories and story elements of other games without contributing anything new. Such games usually do not create huge waves of nostalgia and if they create nostalgia, they fizzle quicker.

Heroes of the Storm is a live game that is effectively on long term live support. It would maybe be better to shut it down if you want to re-release it at any point in the future. By keeping it up, players can get their fix without actually having to put funds into it. Making the incentive for Blizzard to actually look at the game basically 0.

Overwatch is getting Overwatch 2. And we all hope it has something substantially new. Either it needs to go the way Fortnite and CoD Warzone went (not sure the playbase will like it) or have something else. If it's just more of the same, it will not make a big enough splash to justify so many resources over such a long time. Also it won't be re-released ever. Just as with other team shooters, it needs to try to stay afloat perpetually, or it will die.

So what are the 2000+ new devs working on? Stuff like Diablo Immortal. The goal currently is to find gaming fads (in new markets) and slap on Blizzards branding in an effort to drive these players back to existing core games (mostly, WoW, OW and Diablo). So I fully expect a new Warcraft game being in the work, but not being aimed at the classic blizzard crowd. It might be a really speced down version of WoW for groups up to 5 and heavy instancing (like Guildwars 1) for mobile platforms. And from there, players should migrate to the real WoW and it's cash shop.

Something similar might happen to Overwatch. Maybe even Starcraft. For anything truly **new** coming out of Blizzard, they would need to hire strong devs/narrators with a strong engineering core team and let them simmer for a bunch of years. I doubt they have either the people or the internal structure to support that. So the statement

&gt; No. And they won't anytime soon.

As an answer to

Is really correct in that case.",1620200560,6,1620196960.0

It is kind of crazy that the last new non-DLC game they released was Overwatch almost a full five years ago.  Before that they were (relatively) pumping out games with the StarCraft series, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm, and Hearthstone over a similar span.  It's like the period after they released World of Warcraft and went on cruise control while the money rolled in... but they forgot to start the new cash cow.",1620225292,6,1620221692.0

Warcraft – we are waiting for 9.1 and TBC Classic. Game is boring.

30,Quazifuji,"Yeah, of the 5 games listed, WoW has continued getting expansions and WoW classic launched, Hearthstone's continued getting expansions and Battlegrounds happened (which is practically its own game at this point, I think Blizzard just wants to keep treating it as a Hearthstone mode because people don't spend as much money on Battlegrounds), Heroes of the Storm is kind of slowly dying out but it's still getting updates, and Overwatch 2 and Diablo both have sequels in the works.

Starcraft is basically the only series on that list that feels abandoned right now.

That's not to say they've been making quality content or supporting their fans.  I don't blame Diablo or Overwatch fans for feeling frustrated by the long wait for sequels, Heroes of the Storm's already slowed down and it seems like it's only a matter of time before it stops getting updates completely, and plenty of WoW and Hearthstone fans have lost interest in those games (whether they just got tired of them or don't like the direction they've been going it).

There's so much variety available today, and it's all so accessible. FPS's, RPG's, Turn-based strategy games, and other genres common to 2007 (and most of the past) are still available/being released today. Many of those games are well designed, genuinely interesting, and bring something new to the table. Many more, aren't - but that was just as true back in the day as it is today.

On top of that, you've got things that are almost entirely new. Battle Royales still feel like they popped up only yesterday, as did Auto Battlers/Autochess/Pokemon Defense style games, designed-for-digital card games like Hearthstone and Eternal exploded in the early/mid 2010's, randomizer variants of old and new games have come up that test the player's ability to plan a route through a gameworld (or two - SMZ3) over mechanical skill checks, and so on. 

Finally, it's entirely possible to genuinely get a great experience from a game that literally costs nothing. DOTA2/League of Legends/Heroes of the Storm, Eternal/Hearthstone/Magic the Gathering: Arena, Fortnite, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Path of Exile... F2P games tend to get a bad rep in some circles, but no analog to them really existed back in the day, and it's *fantastic* that players always have at least that option.",1619394230,1,1619390630.0
33,yunghollow69,"I can not stress enough that the reason why blizzard is losing players has nothing to do with activision. Blizzard has historically been the slowest company on earth when it comes to A) new products and more importantly B) updating existing IPs.

Players just naturally move on because there is no reason to stay. Stuff like them being greedy, them being suck-ups to china, them getting memed for diablo immortal etc. all makes up for probably less than 1% of players they lost. The vast majority doesnt care. What they care about is playing something that is fun.

Would you play overwatch that even at the height of activity was barely updated or would you play fortnite? Or apex? 

Would you play heroes of the storm on life-support or play league of legends?

Would you play hearthstone or arena, or the game made by riot or maybe one of the free anime cardgames?

And so on. The answer of these questions keeps shifting away from the blizzard games simply because they arent properly supported. Fortnite is very different from OW sure, but both are shooters with one of them getting support by the devs while the other is abandoned.

Diablo 4 or OW 2 wont change anything unless blizzard finally changes its structure. Its 2021 and they are still taking 10 years to release a game that they then patch twice a year. This approach simply does not work anymore.",1620236484,1,1620232884.0

37,stufff,"&gt;The game had 3-5 hours of content (doing hours of MM on a slightly different “shoots stuff” character isn’t more content)

Game also had raids, danger rooms, etc. But it was an ARPG. The ""content"" was grinding for gear. You might as well dump the same criticism on Diablo or any number of other ARPGS. If you don't enjoy endlessly grinding for gear then it's not the kind of game for you, that doesn't make it bad. If you spent all your time in MM playing different ""shoots stuff"" characters that's on you; I mained She-Hulk and also had a lot of time into Storm, Scarlet Witch, and Cable, and they all played pretty differently.

&gt;literally thousands of dollars worth of things you could buy.

So... just like every other free to play game, and even most subscription or premium games now? The fact that there were cosmetics you *could* pay for is irrelevant to whether it was ""way way way overly monetized"" because you could unlock *all of the heroes* for free. You could also get cosmetics for free, though the process was fairly grindy and very RNG heavy; if you wanted a specific cosmetic you pretty much had to buy it... which is not unreasonable in a free to play game.

I played the game for *years* and probably didn't spend more than $30 on it. I paid for the She-Hulk team up, and She-Hulk when she was released as a hero as well as some She-Hulk cosmetics and inventory tab, because I'm a big She-Hulk fan. I also paid for some generic inventory tabs because I like hoarding. I could have easily played without ever dropping a cent on the game, and the little bit of money I did spend was a good value IMO.

Honestly, the game's monetization model (focus on inventory tabs and cosmetics) isn't that different from Path of Exile, which is generally regarded as the gold standard for free to play monetization. The only thing MH added was paying for hero unlocks, which you could also do for free through regular gameplay.",1619802944,1,1619799344.0

Heroes of the Storm is a watered-down MOBA that can't hold an audience.

Starcraft was recently been left in the dust.

Competitive retail Hearthstone is tough to keep up with unless you're okay with spending a significant amount of cash

Their best products right now are WoW Shadowlands, WoW Classic, and Overwatch, and even they have a ton of issues.

Honestly, the game's monetization model (focus on inventory tabs and cosmetics) isn't that different from Path of Exile, which is generally regarded as the gold standard for free to play monetization.

Diablo 3 is the most brain-dead ARPG I've ever played. The gameplay is smooth but that's about all of the credit I can give it.

Heroes of the Storm is a watered-down MOBA that can't hold an audience.

1,Huzsar,"I always was more single player person, so Blizzard to me has been slowly going down hill as far back as Warcraft 3 which was great but, after showing that they could do a story that was more intriguing in Starcraft, WC3 story felt more cookie cutter fantasy. Arthas was the most interesting character and even he was a generic arrogant hero to corrupted villain plot. The rest of the campaigns were serving mostly as a setup for WoW.

WoW was their huge success and what I think is leading their decline. They focus so much on it, that the whole company became just stale. While a lot of people love it, I played and enjoyed it for a month, got bored of it in a second month, and except for 1 or 2 free weekends never touched it again, while they kept just releasing expansions for it and nothing else.

Finally after almost 6 years of nothing but WoW we got Starcraft 2, and while the campaign missions were very well designed, and some characters were fun, the main plot was pretty bland, especially with them retconning Kerrigans and Raynors relationship just so they can have her be a good guy, after all she did in Brood war. Then it all ends with a DBZ fight against a generic bad guy that wants to destroy the world. I did have a lot of fun watching tournaments though.

Diablo 2 did not have a lot of the story but the little it had it was well told, writing was good, and it had that dark gothic feeling. Diablo 3 on the other hand, had some bloody parts but did not feel dark gothic instead it felt like it was from Saturday morning cartoon. You have one bad guy that is described as a great manipulator but you see his twist from a mile away, and other one that is described as a great strategist but his strategy is pretty much throwing wave after wave of his own forces at you while screaming ""I'll get you next time"" after you defeat each one. I also felt like it did not matter what weapon you held just as long as it had a bigger number then the last one you held, maybe I have rose colored glasses but weapons in D2 felt more unique in their attributes from what I remember.

Then we had Hearthstone which was a fun card game but I was done with it soon after trying it, never was into Dota so Heroes of the Storm did not interest me either, Overwatch seemed to me like a good spin on TF2 but I played that game for many years that by that time I was done with that genre, plus loot boxes turned me off.

I did get SC Remastered, and had fun going back, and was going to get WC3 Reforged but that was a mess so thankfully I did not. D2 remaster looks good so I might get that for nostalgia but don't know yet.

Overwatch 2 last time I saw looked like Overwatch 1.2, but maybe they will do something that make it deserve a sequel label. 

Diablo 4 looks ok too but I was hoping for something more. I don't know maybe combine Diablo with combat from Dark Souls, make weapons feel unique, or at least something more interesting then just clicking on the enemy over and over until it dies.

It used to be that when Blizzard made an announcement I was right there. Now its at least the cinematic will be good, but that's about it.",1621637851,30,1621634251.0

Because for example, in Heroes of the Storm there's a bigger emphasis on teamwork and team performance than let's say LoL or DotA, and that usually leads to that even if you are very skilled, you might still be unable to win because the rest of your team can't coordinate, or they outright are not playing well.  
  
Regarding the last point: I'm not implying that a more team-centric game is bad, just in case. Is just that playing solo in a game where you heavily depend on your team can be frustrating because regardless of how good you are, you might get dragged down if you happen to be put with people less skilled than you. But, on the flip side, usually one player underperforming in a more team centric game is less bad, because they can only drag you down so much if the rest of the team know what they are doing.",1625153094,3,1625149494.0

I've gotten sort of interested in a couple of other MOBAs (like Heroes of the Storm because of the IPs) and wanted to try them out, but it's exactly as you say, they all just felt like a far less snappy version. In League it just feels really good to control your character and use your skills.

But there's an extra factor as well, that's perhaps even the bigger one: League has ~150 champions. I know what all of them do, I know (at least a good amount of) what works well with what, I know what's horrible against what, etc. The amount of game knowledge these games require and the depth of skill you have in them, playing another MOBA feels just like ""well, it's kind fun I guess, but if I am to play a MOBA I should just spend this same time learning League instead""",1624951417,2,1624947817.0

Blizzard has multiple projects that needs this batch of talent for and replacing artists and talent isn’t easy, fast or cheap even if you result to hiring out fresh graduates Who don’t care for the company’s current shitstorm. By the time they are onboarded and used to proprietary tools it takes maybe 1 month before you are acclimated to the new environment and even then you need to rely on senior members for knowledge on those tools since they ALWAYS have their quirks and jank. Losing a person who knows your tools inside-out is catastrophic because it makes training new hires incredibly difficult and they would function at a fraction of their full potential. So let’s assume best case scenario you have been on the payroll for 2+ months and just now you’re at the speed of someone you replaced, The company had to ship you hardware since industry wide we are all mostly still working remote and after some mild issues youre meeting your tasks. That’s a strain on the production schedule and in those 2 months maybe some of your older colleagues  got scouted out or left for other reasons, those desks need to get filled. 

Assuming Overwatch 2 is a 2022 release and diabo 3 is 2022-2023, both of those games are in the steps where everyone is hands on working with the game, and further disruptions to the production schedule would probably cause production delays beyond whatever they’re willing to put up with.

21,GiantASian01,"We don't really know at this point, No doubt it will KIND of work though.

You can host a private server, sure, but someone must be in the game to keep the server up, which means that it's unlikely that a server will persist 24/7 and will likely die off in off hours. It will be basically impossible to find the server again unless it's you and a group of 127 other friends who all plan to meet up in the same server for goofy shit. Not to mention that the performance may be iffy depending on where the person is located/ how good their internet is. A dedicated hosting server will always give better performance (which EA did have as a rental that people could pay for in previous battlefield games).

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to lack of persistence, I doubt that Battlefield 2042 will be very open in terms of modification. There are set parameters that server hosters can change and I have no doubt we will see some pretty fun and wild combinations, but nothing like the past games.  


Past games I played had crazy freedom in modding servers. Counter Strike had modded gun game, scouts knivez, surfing, all kinds of wacky shit back in 1.6. Half Life 1 and 2 were so moddable that other than Counter Strike, we got Natural Selection, Day of Defeat, Firearms (a modern day shooter that had a perk system that I will swear that COD4 stole this idea from), Chivalry (which became chivalry medieval warfare 1 and 2), and countless other multiplayer games. 

I remember Battlefield 1942 had some outrageously impressive mods such as the STar Wars themed Galactic Conquest that had full on space battles modded in, or Desert Combat which was basically an alpha for Battlefield 2. Battlefield 2 had the infamous Project Reality mod (mil-sim that's probably still one of the best multiplayer games ever made in my opinion), and all kinds of wild stuff. Squad (which i mentioned previously) is a spiritual successor to this and has many of the same developers.   


Of course, these mods are all free to download and patch onto games so since there's no way of monetizing it, there's no reason to allow people to do this any longer. Really a damn shame, but the positive thing I can think of is the availability of mods and popularity let many fledgling game developers expand into their own studios/ full on projects.   


Some Examples I can think of below:

**Insurgency and Insurgency Sandstorm** developers (New World Interactive) were originally making a Half Life 2 mod, Insurgency: Modern COmbat

**Red Orchestra and now Rising Storm** originally were unreal tournament 2004 mods

**Killing Floor 1 and 2** was another UT 2004 mod

**DOTA 2** , one of the most popular competitive video games ever made, originally was a Warcraft 3 custom game

**Player Unknown Battleground** game that arguably spawned the Battle Royale genre was an Arma 3 mod

**DayZ** game that arguably spawned the multiplayer survival crafting open world spam we see these days was an Arma 2 mod

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just sad I don't think this beautiful flowering of creative energy and democratization of games  development will ever happen again, unless Valve releases a Half Life 3 with all the moddability of 1 and 2, with the power of Source 2, but hey, a man can dream....",1627580102,1,1627576502.0

Yes, but liking a genre and liking the gameplay of a specific game within the genre are also not the same thing. I enjoy the gameplay of League of Legends, but don't enjoy the gameplay of Heroes of the Storm, despite those two being in the same genre. 

Would I like it if Heroes of the Storm had an alternative gameplay mode with mechanics more suited to my taste? Yes I would! I like Blizzard IPs and I'd love to play a MOBA with those characters. But I'm not in the target audience for that game, because the gameplay is more casual than what I want out of a MOBA. But people who play HotS seem to like the more casual experience, and I have League anyway, so why would I go demand they appeal to me as well? No reason, I can live with HotS not being a game for me.

70% of Sekiro is it's combat, and if you change the combat, you change the entire experience.

&gt;	There's the kind of accessibility that is emotional and intellectual, and then there's the kind that just makes it available

Yes, but at the end of the day the emotional/intellectual accessivility dictates your experience quite heavily. But because games are a different medium, the gameplay itself is (in some games, such as the Souls games) the primary component. 

&gt;	It only has that reputation because it never offered these basic options in the first place

And because it is an integral part of the gameplay experience. The combat system in Souls games is nothing special if you take the challenge away, and the exploration is nothing special if you give the player a map with objective markers. 

The whole magic of the games is the lack of mercy, getting your ass kicked, and overcoming the challenge. Remove it, and you have a fairly average action RPG.

&gt;	Somehow I doubt that the presence of water made them incapable of making good tea. But let's say your favorite tea shop suddenly gives people the option to water it down but you choose not to. Is your tea worse?

It's not about the presence of water, it's about the entire philosophy behind the tea shop. If they used to be all about serving their traditional green tea recipe without compromise, and suddenly they're luring in coffee addicts, selling chai lattes and frappuchinos, it's only a matter of time until they stop serving their traditional green tea as you remember it.

It's about artistic vision. You can't have an uncompromised artistic vision AND cater towards mass appeal at the same time.

China had a ban on consoles until 2015. Since then, consoles are selling (albeit less than the west), though PS5 stocks are ""depleted quickly in China"" [according to the Sony CEO.](https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-10-million/)

Most of my Chinese students at the international school I taught at had VPNs, but VPNs are finicky in China with servers/IP addressed blocked frequently. There's also a lag issue with VPNs from my personal experience. 


One thing to add is that even with a western version of a game on Chinese servers such as Heroes of the Storm, you have to register with an account using your Chinese ID, so it's one of the ways in which the government can track and limit your play time.

I hope there is some way to at least brute-force XP-gain just to allow you to progress because you enjoy a specific playstyle, but given the information so far, I'm not optimistic.

I'm not a victim of oppressive racism, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. You don't have to personally experience something to be able to identify it.

&gt;The core loop hasn't changed since launch. You fight players over loot. That was true then and is true now. That's the content. 

Then look at other GaaS. *Heroes of the Storm* for example. The core gameplay loop has remained unchanged since release, but the method of rewarding exclusive skins and ingame currency during events is a tactic used to incite FOMO and keep players coming back routinely.

They clearly wanted to avoid Ms. Marvel because of the recent DOA Avengers title, and that leaves them in a bind.  They can pull in more X-Men, of course - X-Men have no shortage of powerful women.  Kitty Pryde, Emma Frost, Jean Grey, Storm, Rogue, Polaris, Psylock, Armor, Jubilee, Blink, Dust, Marrow, Karma, Mystique, Pixie, you could probably make two game rosters worth of powerful women.

An example of this done poorly is Hunt Showdown.  The daily quests are something like ""go kill The Assassin 3 times"" which sounds good until you realize most people play random contract and you have a 1 in 4ish chance of it showing up, and an even smaller chance of finding it, and an even smaller chance of killing it without getting killed.  

The weekly ones are by far the worst.  I pretty much only ever get ""kill 20 meatheads with a melee weapon"".  At no point would you ever get into melee range with a meathead, which nearly one shots you, and has massive amounts of HP.

Nope, if anything you are underestimating just how profitable games are in this day and age. There's only one group to blame for the work conditions of devs and that's their management, and spoiler alert, mtx never solved that either.

&gt; It really isn't just ""a couple guys"".

In most cases it actually is. Just look at the skins that games like Heroes of the Storm have been putting out long after the game was abandoned by Blizz, they don't have a full art team anymore but they still make skins every now and then.

It's also a good way to offload artists that finished with all necessary assets from a larger project while they wait for something else to do.

&gt; And being Firaxis and Marvel, I highly doubt this game won't see post-launch support.

9,Ralathar44,"&gt; It's Blizzard they can't go 10 days without fucking something up. Honestly I just really hate that company these days and every time they make headlines it's just a bit more negative news (or sometimes a lot more negative). Originally I was excited for Diablo 4 but with their soured reputation recently I may not even purchase it.

IMO this has been the trajectory of the company for many years and Blizz fans have been completely fine with it.  Up until it became unpopular to be so.  The ever forgiving ever loyal fans are part of the problem.

&amp;nbsp;  

I mean I tried to tell people way back when Starcraft 2 released that blizzard was headed in a bad direction.  Dividing the 3 racial campaigns into 3 games was plainly a $ inspired move.  But it was minor then right?  Like Oblivion Horse Armor DLC people didn't understand that the line would continuously be pushed.

SC 2 was the first Blizzard game I did not buy and after playing it, we'll say via a friend's computer, I'm glad I did not buy it.  While not terrible it was definitely not as good as Starcraft 1, retconned alot, ruined a few characters, and had a laughable story.  I liked SOME new aspects, but ultimately it was a significant downgrade in terms of gameplay and story and characters. 

I miss old nuanced monsterish badass Kerrigan over the more sexualized (she was never truly ugly, just more monsterish and less human feeling and how they presented her in game was staggeringly different) stripper heels damsel in distress that has to be saved by a broken drunk like 3 times despite being one of the most powerful beings in the universe.  And losing to him in a 1 vs 1 war for good measure.  I'm no fan of modern feminism, but maybe the writing was on the wall for the current problems even back then with how they changed/treated her character?  Or maybe that's reading too much into it.  Hard to say.  Either way the games were not worth the price and Kerrigan is NOTHING like she was in Brood War.  They stripped her of agency, they focused more on sexualization and they removed the monstrous element (quite literally as part of the plot even), and they made her a semi-helpless character taking back seat to Raynor, but at least they gave her a Kame Hame Ha? Hell even in her fight scene they couldn't help but start it out with an [blatant ass shot](https://youtu.be/v-eJezQV1cY?t=12) and she only wins via a Kamikaze attack after being run through with an energy sword that she apparently heals 100% from in no time and is all. (which is just cheap emotional manipulation)  JFC it's borderline character assassination.

And for the record I think people are normally far too concerned with sexualization and it's used to be shitty about alot of irrelevant stuff.  Main reason I mention it here is that the old Brood War Kerrigan is more monstrous with a touch of humanity.  SC2 Kerrigan is made more sexy and human in thought and in model even before they literally do so as pat of the plot and she can't even get a fight scene cinematic without them focusing on a juicy ass to start it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Diablo 3 was a clusterfuck and people defended it tooth and nail for months.  We see how that turned out.  And then it still felt less Diablo than Path of Exiles or Grim Dawn.  It felt more like Marvel Heroes than a Diablo sequel.

&amp;nbsp;

Then they jumped into Hearthstone and lets face it regardless of whether that's a good game or not that's a cash scam.  Know how I know?  Because I played Magic the Gathering back in the day and that's a cash scam too :P.  Good games with good base rulesets and mechanics and etc mind you, but horribly exploitative in their monetization.

&amp;nbsp; 

Then they released Heros of the Storm.  The grindiest and most heavily monetized MOBA when compared to League, DOTA 2, and Smite.  By like 30%+.  Yes, I did do the math back in the day.  HOTS 2.0 didn't actually change this, just obfuscated it further.  And I LIKE  HOTS.  But yeah, you'll earn heroes slower and pay more per hero relative to other MOBAs.

&amp;nbsp;

People embraced Overwatch with open arms while I outright rejected to lootboxes in a paid game.  Cosmetic or not I did my research on lootboxes early and its a dark hole to research :(.  Alot of people have soured on OVerwatch since then but mainly because they are bad at it and losing is just as frustrating in that game as it is in a MOBA to most folks.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

And only now that they are in deep shit are alot of people calling out Blizzard.  All this time has been fine, but now it's a problem.  I'm sorry but I don't believe like 80% of people.  They willingly went along for the ride and ignored things at every turn and now it's gone badly they are trying to distance themselves.  IMO Overwatch is the latest anyone should have realized modern Blizzard was bad.  I'll give people SC2.  That monetization/retcon shit was more subtle and you can say living up to SC 1 is near impossible. That's fair.  Diablo 3 should have ruffled alot more feathers and been like ""yo, shit is bad"".  But I get it brand loyalty, people wanna believe.  Hearthstone people were basically immunized against by Magic the Gathering and Pokemon.  

But If folks didn't realize how far Blizzard had fallen by Overwatch when they were putting lootboxes in a paid game...honestly they just didn't care at that point.",1628702276,1,1628698676.0

Graphics are surprisingly good and the game runs extremely smooth for a mobile game (thanks to Unreal Engine)

Combat is smooth and fun, characters get up to 5 skills to use (with a max of 10 to switch between for a build), and an ultimate to utilize

Gearing actually changes the look of your character, and they have a LOT of different looks from a bunch of different comic runs including Secret Wars, Fear Itself, Age of X, Civil War II, Shadowlands, and even has MCU Endgame skins.

You have 8 playable characters currently. Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Storm, and Star Lord. You can only have 4 on your team unless you pay MTX to unlock the other 4 slots (not surprising for a mobile game)

Villain wise you have the major storyline villans Thanos, Ultron, Red Skull, Loki, and MODOK. Then you have smaller villains between them like Kingpin, Green Goblin, Baron Mordo, and enemy groups including AIM, Hand, Oscorp, and Hydra.

Plus you also have supporting NPCs to interact with including plenty of other Marvel heroes like Thor, Rocket Raccoon, Nick Fury, Daredevil, Punisher, Moon Knight, Winter Soldier and more.

Aside from that it's your typical mobile game so there's plenty of MTX and monetization (and your daily/monthly login calendars and events). But I ignore most of that, I haven't had any issues earning anything I needed in game where I had to consider buying with real money.

17,Xytal,"So, I hadn't heard about this leak, and someone linked it, so I took a look. My thoughts after donning my tinfoil hat:

- The Diablo stuff makes sense, they've always had hype for that and it seems (ignoring issues) D2: R sold well. I don't know about 3 expansions, but I could definitely see them going hard on the game itself.
- I think the ""9.3 being 10.0"" stuff is more  Shadowlands hasn't gone over well and is them having to switch gears on the next expansion and they are taking what they can to shove into 9.3 so they have content to hand out while they ""break glass in case of emergency"" and give players all sorts of stuff they have wanted for 10.0.
- WotLK being the last classic is a no brainer. People talk about WotLK ALL the time. This makes sense.
- My guess for taking a lot form FFXIV is more so how the questing system (aka MSQ) and class/job system works. Otherwise, a lot of what FFXIV had is based on what WoW changed. So the irony here is funny. Rebooting the story seems the only way for them to fix shit. And I guess, based on the story beats from Shadowlands, I guess if they use the Jailer-nos to reboot the universe, could work - would also make sense for them ending WoW and starting over, a WoW 2, so to speak.
- Hearthstone will stay for as long as it makes money, but them doing a spin off of a popular part of it makes sense (from my understanding, the auto-battler really was/is fun and took off pretty quick).
- Overwatch doesn't surprise me. I could either see them scrapping the PvE stuff and launching Overwatch 2 just to get it out the door, since I believe it has an updated engine and I'm not sure if they can port backwards. But if possible, I could see that. Would make much more sense to just drop as much as they can, polish what they have, and launch that.
- Starcraft (and Heroes of the Storm), yea... these are dead, have been dead, they are just hanging on by threads a this point.
- And finally, the name change. This makes the most sense. Distance themselves from the name that has taken a huge hit, spin it with saying they are looking inward to make a better &amp; more inclusive company and games (insight! See!) and run that way as fast as they can.

It really feels like, these last few years, we've been watching the slow, slow death of Blizzard. It fucking sucks. I used to play their games and nothing else.

This is the only accurate part of your comment.

&gt; they said that harassment was happening openly in the workplace

This is misleading, as Blizzard is not ""one workplace"" where everybody sees everything at all times. It's a lot of workplaces comprised of a lot of offices. Just because something was happening ""in the workplace where everyone could see it"" at the WoW office for example doesn't mean anything for other teams like Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, or Overwatch.

&gt; and nobody made ANY of it public

This is straight up false, as stories of harassment at Blizzard have been shared publicly on social media for years, and within Blizzard there are many accounts of employees trying to do the right thing and lodge complaints or speak to HR to make their workplace better. 

&gt; I do think people kept quiet about it, actually.

That's not what he asked you. Obviously SOME people kept quiet about SOME things. But you're now alleging that every employee at Blizzard knew everything and kept quiet about everything.

First was **Aven Colony**. I started the first campaign mission, played for about 10-20 minutes or so, but then dropped it. I do like the premise, but there was nothing compelling to it for me. City builders are often like that. And at least with City Skylines, I get to make a nice looking (or try to, I most often fail) city. In Aven Colony it just ends up being a mess of random machinery that doesn't look nice.

The other free epic game was **PC Building Simulator** - did a bit of stuff on that, mostly just wanted to try it out. Didn't realize it was like, an actual game. I figured it would just be a 3D show-case of how to build a PC. It's neat. I might use it to simulate building my dream upgrade-PC, though I suck with parts anyway so it's unlikely.

Other than that, I've just finished the fourth victory type in **Civilization: Beyond Earth**, only got one left. Then I might just put the game on the shelf really. I do like Beyond Earth, it's like playing Civ V, but fresh and new again, because I don't know its systems or tech tree that well. It's got some cool ideas; I like diplomatic capital and personality traits (though I'm not crazy about how other leaders don't respect me over stupid shit like ""Your units aren't leveled up enough""), I like upgrading units into new versions of themselves. Speaking of, there's an absurd amount of units in Beyond Earth, especially with the hybrid units added by Rising Tide. It's actually kinda... too much? Feel like it could do with some condensing.

Oh! And I've played some **Heroes of the Storm** against my better judgement. Actually dipping my toes into playing against actual people and not just AI. It's neat.

Unless you had some specific reason to believe you could make it work, some kind of unique advantage so you aren't just trying to do X but better the risk is super dubious.

DotA is obviously the start of it all.  It was amazingly fun.  Now we all know blizzard, but they didn't take good advantage of it.  They had an amazing fan made game that could be its own.  

DotA2 came out but it just took too long.  It's also not noob friendly.  Turn animation, denial, item recipes, hidden shops, chicken management, it just adds up.  DotA2 added more types of runes.  It just got tougher to get into.

League of legends came between the whole fiasco and delays of DotA and DotA2.  MobAs were starting to take advantage but LoL was better quality than most.  It had a easier art style for a broader range [girls and younger players].  They are just entertaining.  They have music videos.  High quality animations.  Even not gamer girls can find it enjoyable.  They also just kept snowballing.  Using the extra money to produce even more.  Now they are making more games based on their game.  They also got the monster tencent funding it.

Heroes of the Storm...again its blizzard.  They made a wonderful game.  It is much more casual.  If you are a blizzard fan, its cool seeing all the characters.  But....I see two main issues.  Blizzard just got early good games.  Or ideas they already had and used that.  But everything after...they just keep fucking up.  They messed up esports repeatedly and stopped supporting the game.  Other reason is its a bit too casual.  It just isn't as impressive if there is a well played play as much as the other games.

Yes, because as has been proven time and time again in the gaming space, mass market accessibility is the way to go. Fortnite, Mobile Games, Minecraft, League. All of these games are utterly massive and their one common factor is that they're made for the widest, most casual audience. Of course League is going to have millions more players, it's barrier to entry is nonexistant. Not to mention the fact that its marketing budget is easily in the upper hundreds of millions. Compare that to Dota with it's barrier to entry being an enormous cliff and its marketing budget being in the upper hundreds of dollars, and it's not hard to figure out why League is more popular.

Other than that, I've just finished the fourth victory type in **Civilization: Beyond Earth**, only got one left. Then I might just put the game on the shelf really. I do like Beyond Earth, it's like playing Civ V, but fresh and new again, because I don't know its systems or tech tree that well. It's got some cool ideas; I like diplomatic capital and personality traits (though I'm not crazy about how other leaders don't respect me over stupid shit like ""Your units aren't leveled up enough""), I like upgrading units into new versions of themselves. Speaking of, there's an absurd amount of units in Beyond Earth, especially with the hybrid units added by Rising Tide. It's actually kinda... too much? Feel like it could do with some condensing.

Oh! And I've played some **Heroes of the Storm** against my better judgement. Actually dipping my toes into playing against actual people and not just AI. It's neat. I like playing tanks I think, peeling for my team and setting up enemies for my DPS to finish off. It's nice. HotS development being comatose still depresses me.",1637534524,6,1637530924.0

DotA is obviously the start of it all.  It was amazingly fun.  Now we all know blizzard, but they didn't take good advantage of it.  They had an amazing fan made game that could be its own.  

DotA2 came out but it just took too long.  It's also not noob friendly.  Turn animation, denial, item recipes, hidden shops, chicken management, it just adds up.  DotA2 added more types of runes.  It just got tougher to get into.

League of legends came between the whole fiasco and delays of DotA and DotA2.  MobAs were starting to take advantage but LoL was better quality than most.  It had a easier art style for a broader range [girls and younger players].  They are just entertaining.  They have music videos.  High quality animations.  Even not gamer girls can find it enjoyable.  They also just kept snowballing.  Using the extra money to produce even more.  Now they are making more games based on their game.  They also got the monster tencent funding it.

Heroes of the Storm...again its blizzard.  They made a wonderful game.  It is much more casual.  If you are a blizzard fan, its cool seeing all the characters.  But....I see two main issues.  Blizzard just got early good games.  Or ideas they already had and used that.  But everything after...they just keep fucking up.  They messed up esports repeatedly and stopped supporting the game.  Other reason is its a bit too casual.  It just isn't as impressive if there is a well played play as much as the other games.

DotA2 came out but it just took too long.  It's also not noob friendly.  Turn animation, denial, item recipes, hidden shops, chicken management, it just adds up.  DotA2 added more types of runes.  It just got tougher to get into.

League of legends came between the whole fiasco and delays of DotA and DotA2.  MobAs were starting to take advantage but LoL was better quality than most.  It had a easier art style for a broader range [girls and younger players].  They are just entertaining.  They have music videos.  High quality animations.  Even not gamer girls can find it enjoyable.  They also just kept snowballing.  Using the extra money to produce even more.  Now they are making more games based on their game.  They also got the monster tencent funding it.

Heroes of the Storm...again its blizzard.  They made a wonderful game.  It is much more casual.  If you are a blizzard fan, its cool seeing all the characters.  But....I see two main issues.  Blizzard just got early good games.  Or ideas they already had and used that.  But everything after...they just keep fucking up.  They messed up esports repeatedly and stopped supporting the game.  Other reason is its a bit too casual.  It just isn't as impressive if there is a well played play as much as the other games.

In the end, League is the best in the moba genre in terms of entertainment to a wider crowd.",1637577534,2,1637573934.0

OW - I mean the game was popular but it didn’t “popularized hero shooters” in the way you imagine it did. It just didn’t have any competition that could actually stand up to it, and TF2 is over a decade old. If you want to make that argument about Overwatch, then League did the exact same thing to MOBAs, and absolutely rolled its competition. Heroes of Newerth? Dead. Dota2 is alive and well but to even compare it to how popular League is, is a joke. Heroes of the Storm is dead. League has left every moba that has come out since as a dead husk. 

“League popularized MOBAs in a way that DOTA never could.” See how easy that statement is to make?",1636501477,7,1636497877.0
60,MrManicMarty,"I tried two games today, both ones I got on Epic Games for free.

First was **Aven Colony**. I started the first campaign mission, played for about 10-20 minutes or so, but then dropped it. I do like the premise, but there was nothing compelling to it for me. City builders are often like that. And at least with City Skylines, I get to make a nice looking (or try to, I most often fail) city. In Aven Colony it just ends up being a mess of random machinery that doesn't look nice.

The other free epic game was **PC Building Simulator** - did a bit of stuff on that, mostly just wanted to try it out. Didn't realize it was like, an actual game. I figured it would just be a 3D show-case of how to build a PC. It's neat. I might use it to simulate building my dream upgrade-PC, though I suck with parts anyway so it's unlikely.

Other than that, I've just finished the fourth victory type in **Civilization: Beyond Earth**, only got one left. Then I might just put the game on the shelf really. I do like Beyond Earth, it's like playing Civ V, but fresh and new again, because I don't know its systems or tech tree that well. It's got some cool ideas; I like diplomatic capital and personality traits (though I'm not crazy about how other leaders don't respect me over stupid shit like ""Your units aren't leveled up enough""), I like upgrading units into new versions of themselves. Speaking of, there's an absurd amount of units in Beyond Earth, especially with the hybrid units added by Rising Tide. It's actually kinda... too much? Feel like it could do with some condensing.

Oh! And I've played some **Heroes of the Storm** against my better judgement. Actually dipping my toes into playing against actual people and not just AI. It's neat. I like playing tanks I think, peeling for my team and setting up enemies for my DPS to finish off. It's nice. HotS development being comatose still depresses me.",1637534524,6,1637530924.0
61,Sarasin,"It is also easier to remember the misses because there are vastly more of them. Even allowing for Smite which isn't remotely close to as successful as the rest of the list just searching for say mobas on steam will demonstrate my point with literally hundreds of examples. I'm sure a decent amount wouldn't properly count as a decent example but far more than enough do. Trend chasing isn't impossible in gaming, just very difficult and risky compared to other industries. Trying to grab a slice of an already captive audience isn't impossible but it is very difficult and risky to attempt. Unless you had some specific reason to believe you could make it work, some kind of unique advantage so you aren't just trying to do X but better the risk is super dubious.

Becoming a big success in basically anything is incredibly hard as it is and investing vast sums of money developing a AAA title assuming you will be able to wrestle your way to the top of the heap is how you get things like Anthem, or a more favorable example like Heroes of the Storm which was still a total failure when it came to actually competing with LoL and Dota 2.",1637379275,4,1637375675.0
62,Jakfolisto,"The usage of the terms microtransactions and paid DLC have become blurred at this point. I'm not sure if the TF2 hat market back then would be called microtransactions, but it's definitely a market to trade money for digital goods between two players. Just like Diablo 3 auction house when it first came out the same year.

The only AAA game I can think of that may actually had microtransactions are definitely sport games like FIFA 12,13. Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone are close. Add Dota2 and LoL if you consider them AAA as well.",1637461968,4,1637458368.0
63,fkurgdmidtbrn,"Change that to ""most game players,"" lmao, it was the same in fucking *Heroes of the Storm* on maps where you literally fucking just lose if you don't go to the objective. Most people who aren't at the highest tier of play in PvP games just do not give a SHIT about the game mode, they just want to kill things.",1637279188,4,1637275588.0
64,Smart_Ass_Dave,"I have been AFK timer-ed only one time in my gaming life. It was not when my cat threw up on my desk as I was playing Heroes of the Storm. It was after my cat started to eat the throw up.
