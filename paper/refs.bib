    abstract = { Executive SummaryPredicting stock trends in the financial market is always demanding but satisfying as well. With the growing power of computing and the recent development of graphics processing unit and tensor processing unit, analysts and researchers are applying advanced techniques such as machine learning techniques more and more to predict stock price trends. In recent years, researchers have developed several algorithms to predict stock trends. To assist investors interested in investing in the stock market, preferably for a short period, it has become necessary to review research papers dealing on machine learning and analyse the importance of their findings in the context of how stock price trends generate trading signals. In this article, to achieve the stated task, authors scrutinized more than 50 research papers focusing on various machine learning algorithms with varied levels of input variables and found that though the performance of models measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE) for regression and accuracy score for classification models varied greatly, long short-term memory (LSTM) model displayed higher accuracy amongst the machine and deep learning models reviewed. However, reinforcement learning algorithm performance measured by profitability and Sharpe ratio outperformed all. In general, traders can maximize their profits by using machine learning instead of using technical analysis. Technical analysis is very easy to implement, but the profit based on it can vanish too soon or making a profit using technical analysis is almost difficult because of its simplicity. Hence, studying machine, deep and reinforcement learning algorithms is vital for traders and investors. These findings were based on the literature review consolidated in the result section. }

abstract = {This paper studies the advances in time series forecasting models using artificial neural network methodologies in a systematic literature review. The systematic review has been done using a manual search of the published papers in the last 11 years (2006–2016) for the time series forecasting using new neural network models and the used methods are displayed. In the covered period in the study, the results obtained found 17 studies that meet all the requirements of the search criteria. Only three of the obtained proposals considered a process different to the autoregressive of a neural networks model. These results conclude that, although there are many studies that presented the application of neural network models, but few of them proposed new neural networks models for forecasting that considered theoretical support and a systematic procedure in the construction of model. This leads to the importance of formulating new models of neural networks.}

abstract = {Load modeling is one of the crucial tasks for improving smart grids’ energy efficiency. Among many alternatives, machine learning-based load models have become popular in applications and have shown outstanding performance in recent years. The performance of these models highly relies on data quality and quantity available for training. However, gathering a sufficient amount of high-quality data is time-consuming and extremely expensive. In the last decade, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their potential to solve the data shortage problem by generating synthetic data by learning from recorded/empirical data. Educated synthetic datasets can reduce prediction error of electricity consumption when combined with empirical data. Further, they can be used to enhance risk management calculations. Therefore, we propose RCGAN, TimeGAN, CWGAN, and RCWGAN which take individual electricity consumption data as input to provide synthetic data in this study. Our work focuses on one dimensional times series, and numerical experiments on an empirical dataset show that GANs are indeed able to generate synthetic data with realistic appearance.}

abstract = {Deep learning is an exciting topic. It has been utilized in many areas owing to its strong potential. For example, it has been widely used in the financial area which is vital to the society, such as high-frequency trading, portfolio optimization, fraud detection and risk management. Stock market prediction is one of the most popular and valuable areas in finance. In this paper, it proposes a stock prediction model using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) used as a generator that inputs historical stock price and generates future stock price and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a discriminator to discriminate between the real stock price and generated stock price. Different from the traditional methods, which limited the forecasting on one-step-ahead only, by contrast, using the deep learning algorithm is possible to conduct the multi-step ahead prediction more accurately. In this study, it chose the Apple Inc. stock closing price as the target price, with features such as S&P 500 index, NASDAQ Composite index, U.S. Dollar index, etc. In addition, FinBert has been utilized to generate a news sentiment index for Apple Inc. as an additional predicting feature. Finally, this paper compares the proposed GAN model results with the baseline model.},

abstract = {This research examines the efficacy of technical analysis and predictive modeling in defining the optimal strategy for investing in the stocks indices of emerging markets. Trading strategies are set regarding different technical indicators based on moving averages and volatility of the value and returns on stock indices. Simple trading rules are generated using two moving averages – a long period and a short period moving average, and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Selected technical indicators are used as features in defining predictive model based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs). A LS-SVM classifier has been used in order to predict trend of the stock indices’ value whereby the obtained outputs of the LS-SVM model are binary signals that can be used for defining the trading strategy. Comparing the results obtained from traditional statistical methods for predicting the trend of financial series and proposed LS-SVM model, it can be concluded that machine learning techniques capture the non-linear models which are dominant in the financial markets in more adequate way. Outperforming the results of Buy & Hold strategy and technical trading strategies, application of LS-SVM in decision making process on investing on the financial market significantly can contribute to maximization of profitability on investment.}
